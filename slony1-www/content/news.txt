<li> Bug # 113 - DROP cloneNodePrepare since the return type changes.
  Patch from Atte Peltomäki
<li> Improve configure complaint if it can't find PQunescapeBytea - this
  likely implies that configure couldn't find libpq.

<li> Copyright date changes

<li> Added discussion of synchronous commit to documentation

<li> Removed some discussion of behaviours relating to ancient versions
  of PostgreSQL that are no longer supported (David Fetter)

<li> SPI_getbinval() was being passed a NULL, which PostgreSQL 8.5 no
  longer accepts.  Add isnull variable in the relevant code block so
  there's a place to stow the bool result.

 <P> Reason for this noted by Alvaro Herrera - thanks!

<li> Change "long long" to "int64" to make things consistent with how
  PostgreSQL expresses XIDs.

<li> Similarly "%lld" in printf changed to INT64_FORMAT

<li> Fixing up detection by Slonik of PostgreSQL 8.4 (patch per Peter
  Eisentraut) - bug #116

<li>Updates to copyright dates on files

<li>Bug #98 - need WAIT ON parameter in slonik code generated by
  slonik_move_set altperl script.

<li>Change default $LOGDIR, so that distros won't need to patch it.

<li>Fix LOG_NAME_SUFFIX feature. Thanks to David Fetter and Andrew Dunstan.

<li>Improve documentation on EVENT NODE for STORE NODE command

<li>SLONLOG directory changes for Red Hat-related distributions

<li>Bug #97 - insert into sl_setsync upon FAILOVER had values() clause based on the
  pre-2.0 schema; fix to use 2.0.

<li>UPGRADE FUNCTIONS failing because functions had their return types changed.
  Added in "DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS" (fine in 8.3+) in
  src/backend/slony1_funcs.sql to rectify this.

<li>As observed by Bernd Helmle, cloneNodePrepare returns an event ID,
  and hence should return BIGINT

<li>Introduced ShouldSlonyVacuumTable() function for 8.3 so we cope with
  differences in vacuum handling between 8.3 and 8.4+

<li>Fix 8.4-ism relating to subscription retries
  <a href="http://lists.slony.info/pipermail/slony1-commit/2009-October/002728.html"> see commit notes </a>

<li> Doc fixes
<li> Fixes to integer castings - don't assume this is automagically handled
<li> Changed return types of functions returning event numbers <tt>bigint</tt> 
<li> Fixes to altperl samples and such

<li>PostgreSQL 8.4 has been released; slonik needs to explicitly recognize it

<li>Add in slonikconfdump.sh tool, which generates a slonik script to duplicate
  the configuration of a Slony-I cluster

<li>Significant fixes to documentation to reflect 2.0 changes

<li>Add "OMIT COPY" option to the Slonik "SUBSCRIBE SET" command

<li>Document process for Slony-I 2.0 upgrade using OMIT COPY option

<li>Fix to race condition where file descriptor copies were being made at
  the wrong time in the scheduler

<li>Modify "testseqnames" regression test to create a whole bunch of
  sequences to validate that things don't break down with either lots of
  them, or where IDs are large numbers

<li>Change minimum debugging level to -1 to allow suppressing logging

<li>Bug #92 - compression of event numbers had a bug where events >
  2^31-1 would overflow the "int" value

<li>Autovacuum handling changes in PostgreSQL 8.4 - we pull metadata
  from pg_class.reloptions, instead of pg_autovacuum

<li>logswitch fix resolving a potential data loss + statement blocking
  bug...

  Before attempting to TRUNCATE the sl_log_* tables, we need to
  successfully request an exclusive lock.  By doing so in an
  exception block with NOWAIT option, this can "lose" gracefully.

<li>Add LOG_NAME_SUFFIX to altperl tools

</ul>

Chris Browne

Version <a href=
"http://main.slony.info/downloads/2.0/source/slony1-2.0.2.tar.bz2">
slony1-2.0.2.tar.bz2 </a> has been released.

<p>Changes since 2.0.1 are as follows:

<ul>
<li> PostgreSQL 8.4 compatibility - src/backend/slony1_funcs.c needed to
  #include "catalog/pg_type.h"; that is no longer implicitly included by
  the SPI #include

<li> Fix bug #71 - config dump was failing on string entries that were NULL

<li> Fix bug #76 - REPAIR CONFIG could have collisions where, when we 
  load a schema, one entry in sl_table already has an OID value
  that incorrectly matches a value that another update is trying to
  fix.

<P>  This would cause REPAIR CONFIG to fail.

<P>  Put in a query that updates the oids in sl_table and sl_sequence to
  randomly selected values from pg_class that couldn't match (since
  the values selected are from non-table/non-sequence objects)

<li> Updated release notes to indicate that 2.0 only supports PostgreSQL
  8.3+

<li> Change to configure.ac to allow it to run on autoconf 2.63; there was
  something unsuitable about SLONREL_VERSION processing

<li> Fixes to Makefile for admin guide

<li> Various fixes to admin guide material

<li> Added an extra test to Schema name test that validates that things
  can operate properly even if the DB lacks a "public" schema

<li> Fixed bug in tools/start_slon.sh

<li> Fixed pathname substitutions in a couple of altperl scripts

<li> Add a test which validates that the cluster schema name is valid; 
  pgAdminIII allowed setting up cluster names that slonik would refuse
  to connect to.

<li> Revised regression tests to use SYNC/WAIT FOR EVENT instead of
  queries that try to coordinate sl_status information with rather
  less determinacy...

</ul>

Slony-I 2.0.1 Released
http://main.slony.info/downloads/2.0/source/slony1-2.0.1.tar.bz2
2009-02-26
Chris Browne

<P> This release addresses a number of issues found in 2.0.0

<ul>
<li> Bug #69 - vactables type was being referenced before UPGRADE FUNCTIONS could actually have created it, when upgrading from an earlier version.

<P>  This would cause UPGRADE FUNCTIONS to fail.

<li> Bug #64 - use of syslog levels had some inappropriate break statements so that some logging would get lost.

<P> If you had multiple clusters where one cluster name was a substring of the other, slon-tools.pm could find
  both when looking for slon processes relevant to the shorter cluster name.  Added a space to the relevant
  bit of slon-tools.pm

<li> Failover had an insert into sl_event where # of columns provided didn't match those expected.  This
  resulted from the change of snapshot handling which used to involve 3 columns where in 8.3+, there is
  now a snapshot type.

<li> Fix syntax error in tools/altperl/slon_watchdog.pl

<li> Add cleanup_interval example to sample slon.conf file

<li> Add cleanup_interval configuration configuration to regression tests

<li> Add documentation for complex failover scenario

<li> Revise installation notes to indicate that xxid.so no longer exists in Slony-I 2.0+

<li> Fix documentation typos

<li> Fixed error with cleanup code which was not purging old data in sl_log_1/sl_log_2

<li> Fix altperl/slontools errors

<li> Added in preliminaries for upgrade from 1.2 to 2.0 - discussion of what the tool
  needs to do

<li> Bug #63 - Array overrun in logtrigger()
</ul>

No way currently to upgrade from Slony-I 1.2.x to 2.0.x
http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69
2008-12-19
Chris Browne

<P> Unfortunately, it needs to be noted that there is not, as of yet,
an upgrade procedure to upgrade an installation of Slony-I 1.2.x to
2.0.  At present, upgrading to 2.0 will essentially require dropping
out replication and recreating it.

<P> We hope to have an answer as to how to deal with this in the new year.

Slony-I 2.0.0 Released
http://main.slony.info/downloads/2.0/source/slony1-2.0.0.tar.bz2
2008-11-24
Chris Browne

Differences from 1.2 stream

<ul>
<li> Removal of TABLE ADD KEY

<li> It drops all support for databases prior to Postgres version 8.3.

<p>This is required because we now make use of new functionality in
Postgres, namely the trigger and rule support for session replication
role. As of now, every node (origin/subscriber/mixed) can be dumped with
pg_dump and result in a consistent snapshot of the database.

<li> Still need alterTableRestore() for the upgrade from 1.2.x to 2.0.
upgradeSchema() will restore the system catalog to a consistent
state and define+configure the new versions of the log and deny_access
triggers. 

<li> Fix EXECUTE SCRIPT so that it records the ev_seqno for WAIT FOR EVENT
and make sure all DDL is executed in session_replication_role "local"
on the origin as well as all subscribers. This will cause the slony
triggers to ignore all DML statements while user triggers follow the
regular configuration options for ENABLE [REPLICA/ALWAYS] or DISABLE.

<li> Let the logshipping files also switch to session_replication_role =
"replica" or "local" (for DDL).

<li> Sequence tracking becomes enormously less expensive; rather than
polling *ALL* sequence values for each and every SYNC, the slon
stores the last value, and only records entries in sl_seqlog when
the value changes from that last value.  If most sequences are
relatively inactive, they won't require entries in sl_seqlog very
often.

<li> Change to tools/slony1_dump.sh (used to generate log shipping dump);
  change quoting of "\\\backslashes\\\" to get rid of warning

<li> Cleanup thread revised to push most of the logic to evaluate which
  tables are to be vacuumed into a pair of stored functions.

<P>  This fairly massively simplifies the C code.

<li> Revised logging levels so that most of the interesting messages are
  spit out at SLON_CONFIG and SLON_INFO levels.  This can allow users
  to drop out the higher DEBUG levels and still have useful logs.

<li> Changed log selection query to be less affected by long running
  transaction.  This should help, in particular, the scenario where
  it takes a very long time to subscribe to a set.  In that situation,
  we have had the problem where applying the later SYNCs gets
  extremely costly as the query selecting logs wound up forced into a
  Seq Scan rather than an index scan.

<li> Removed all support for STORE/DROP TRIGGER commands. Users 
  should use the ALTER TABLE [ENABLE|DISABLE] TRIGGER functionality 
  available directly in Postgres from now on.

<li> Improve Wiki page generation script so that it has an option to add in
  a set of [[Category:Foo]] tags to allow automated categorization.

<li> Documented how to fix tables that presently use Slony-I-generated
  primary key candidates generated by TABLE ADD KEY

<li> Add some specific timestamps during the 2007 "DST rule change
  ambiguous time" (e.g. - during the period which, under former rules,
  was not DST, but which now is, due to the recent rule change).

<P>  Bill Moran ran into some problems with such dates; varying
  PostgreSQL versions returned somewhat varying results.  This wasn't
  a Slony-I problem; the data was indeed being replicated correctly.

<li> Made configure a bit smarter about automatically locating
  docbook2man-spec.pl on Debian, Fedora, BSD.

<li> Tests now generate |pipe|delimited|output| indicating a number of
  attributes of each test, including system/platform information,
  versions, and whether or not the test succeeded or failed.

<li> Revised functions that generate listen paths

<li> tools/configure-replication.sh script permits specifying a
  destination path for generated config files.  This enables using
  it within automated processes, and makes it possible to use it to
  generate Slonik scripts for tests in the "test bed," which has
  the further merit of making tools/configure-replication.sh a
  regularly-regression-tested tool.

<li> Fix to bug #15 - where long cluster name (>40 chars) leads to
  things breaking when an index name is created that contains
  the cluster name.

  <P> Warn upon creating a long cluster name.
  <p> Give a useful exception that explains the cause rather
     than merely watching index creation fail.

<p><a href=   "http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15"> Bug 15 </a>

<li> Fix for bug #19 - added a script to help the administrator
  search for any triggers on the database that is the source for
  a schema that is to be used to initialize a log shipping node.

<p>  The problem is that some/most/sometimes all triggers and rules
  are likely to need to be dropped from the log shipping node lest
  they interfere with replication.

<li> Elimination of custom "xxid" functions

<P>  PostgreSQL 8.3 introduces a set of "txid" functions and a
  "txid_snapshot" type, which eliminates the need for Slony-I to have
  its own C functions for doing XID comparisons.

<p>  Note that this affects the structure of sl_event, and leads to some
  changes in the coding of the regression tests.

<p>  This eliminates the src/xxid directory and contents

<li> All of the interesting cleanup work is now done in the stored
  function, cleanupEvent(interval, boolean).

<p>  Interesting side-effect: You can now induce a cleanup manually,
  which will be useful for testing.

<li> cleanupEvent now has two parameters, passed in from slon config
  parameters:

<P>  interval - cleanup_interval (default '10 minutes')

<p>   This controls how quickly old events are trimmed out.  It used to
   be a hard-coded value.

<p>   Old events are trimmed out once the confirmations are aged by
   (cleanup_interval).

<p>   This then controls when the data in sl_log_1/sl_log_2 can be
   dropped.

<p>   Data in *those* tables is deleted when it is older than the
   earliest XID still captured in sl_event.

<p>  boolean - cleanup_deletelogs (default 'false')

<P>   This controls whether or not we DELETE data from sl_log_1/sl_log_2

<p>   By default, we now NEVER delete data from the log tables; we
   instead use TRUNCATE.

<li> We now consider initiating a log switch every time cleanupEvent()
  runs.

<P>  If the call to logswitch_finish() indicates that there was no log
  switch in progress, we initiate one.

<P>  This means that log switches will be initiated almost as often as
  possible.  That's a policy well worth debating :-).

<li> logswitch_finish() changes a fair bit...

<P>  It uses the same logic as in cleanupEvent() to determine if there
  are any *relevant* tuples left in sl_log_[whatever], rather than
  (potentially) scanning the table to see if there are any undeleted
  tuples left.

<li> At slon startup time, it logs (at SLON_CONFIG level) all of the
  parameter values.  Per <a href="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21"> Bugzilla entry #21.</a>

  
<li> New slonik "CLONE PREPARE" and "CLONE FINISH" command to assist in
  creating duplicate nodes based on taking a copy of some existing
  subscriber node.

<li> We no longer use LISTEN/NOTIFY for events and confirmations, which
  eliminates the usage that has caused pg_listener bloat.  We instead
  poll against the event table.

<li> Various instances where slonik would use a default node ID of 1 have
  been changed to remove this.

<P>  Slonik scripts may need to be changed to indicate an EVENT NODE (or
  similar) after migration to v2.0 as a result.

<P>  The slonik commands involved:

<ul>
  <li> STORE NODE - EVENT NODE
  <li> DROP NODE - EVENT NODE
  <li> WAIT FOR EVENT - WAIT ON
  <li> FAILOVER - BACKUP NODE
  <li> EXECUTE SCRIPT - EVENT NODE
</ul>

<li> Fixed a problem where ACCEPT_SET would wait for the corresponding
  MOVE_SET or FAILOVER_SET to arrive while holding an exclusive lock
  on sl_config_lock, preventing the other remote worker to process
  that event.

<li> Bug #54 - quite a few Bash-isms in various scripts have been
  addressed so as to make the shell scripts more portable.

<li> Bug #18 - the function parameter for the logtrigger functions no
  longer requires any trailing v's

<P>  Add a test to "test1" to make sure this logic gets exercised.

<li> Created "start_slon.sh", an rc.d-style script for starting,
  stopping, and checking status of slon processes.

<P>  Integrated this into the regression tests, replacing previous
  logic for starting/stopping slons, so that this script can be
  considered carefully tested

<li> Bug #46 - incompatibility with PostgreSQL 8.4 addressed

<li> Use dollar quoting in stored functions

<li> Additional logging of the time spent running queries, broken out on
  a by-database basis

<li> Fixes to documentation of WAIT FOR EVENT

<li> Fix to bug #63 - cleanup thread had an imperative SELECT that needed
  to become part of an IF statement

<li> Enhancement - bug #61 - logshipper process should rescan the queue
  when it empties

<li> Note about "duct tape" tests:  There are many of these tests that
  reside in src/ducttape that reference features removed in v2.0.

<P>  We will eventually be replacing these with a more proper "test suite"
  so we're not remedying all the ducttape tests.

http://main.slony.info/downloads/2.0/source/slony1-2.0.0-rc1.tar.bz2
2008-06-27
Chris Browne

Now available is a first release candidate of version 2.0 of Slony-I,
involving a large number of enhancements done over the last year or
so.<br>

<b>Differences from 1.2 stream</b>

<ul>
<li> Removal of TABLE ADD KEY

<li> It drops all support for databases prior to Postgres version 8.3.

<P> This is required because we now make use of new functionality in
Postgres, namely the trigger and rule support for session replication
role. As of now, every node (origin/subscriber/mixed) can be dumped with
pg_dump and result in a consistent snapshot of the database.

<li> Still need alterTableRestore() for the upgrade from 1.2.x to 2.0.
upgradeSchema() will restore the system catalog to a consistent
state and define+configure the new versions of the log and deny_access
triggers. 

<li> Fix EXECUTE SCRIPT so that it records the ev_seqno for WAIT FOR EVENT
and make sure all DDL is executed in session_replication_role "local"
on the origin as well as all subscribers. This will cause the slony
triggers to ignore all DML statements while user triggers follow the
regular configuration options for ENABLE [REPLICA/ALWAYS] or DISABLE.

<li> Let the logshipping files also switch to session_replication_role =
"replica" or "local" (for DDL).

<li> Sequence tracking becomes enormously less expensive; rather than
polling *ALL* sequence values for each and every SYNC, the slon
stores the last value, and only records entries in sl_seqlog when
the value changes from that last value.  If most sequences are
relatively inactive, they won't require entries in sl_seqlog very
often.

<li> Change to tools/slony1_dump.sh (used to generate log shipping dump);
  change quoting of "\\\backslashes\\\" to get rid of warning

<li> Cleanup thread revised to push most of the logic to evaluate which
  tables are to be vacuumed into a pair of stored functions.

<P>  This fairly massively simplifies the C code.

<li> Revised logging levels so that most of the interesting messages are
  spit out at SLON_CONFIG and SLON_INFO levels.  This can allow users
  to drop out the higher DEBUG levels and still have useful logs.

<li> Changed log selection query to be less affected by long running
  transaction.  This should help, in particular, the scenario where
  it takes a very long time to subscribe to a set.  In that situation,
  we have had the problem where applying the later SYNCs gets
  extremely costly as the query selecting logs wound up forced into a
  Seq Scan rather than an index scan.

<li> Removed all support for STORE/DROP TRIGGER commands. Users 
  should use the ALTER TABLE [ENABLE|DISABLE] TRIGGER functionality 
  available directly in Postgres from now on.

<li> Improve Wiki page generation script so that it has an option to add in
  a set of [[Category:Foo]] tags to allow automated categorization.

<li> Documented how to fix tables that presently use Slony-I-generated
  primary key candidates generated by TABLE ADD KEY

<li> Add some specific timestamps during the 2007 "DST rule change
  ambiguous time" (e.g. - during the period which, under former rules,
  was not DST, but which now is, due to the recent rule change).

<P>  Bill Moran ran into some problems with such dates; varying
  PostgreSQL versions returned somewhat varying results.  This wasn't
  a Slony-I problem; the data was indeed being replicated correctly.

<li> Made configure a bit smarter about automatically locating
  docbook2man-spec.pl on Debian, Fedora, BSD.

<li> Tests now generate |pipe|delimited|output| indicating a number of
  attributes of each test, including system/platform information,
  versions, and whether or not the test succeeded or failed.

<li> Revised functions that generate listen paths

<li> tools/configure-replication.sh script permits specifying a
  destination path for generated config files.  This enables using
  it within automated processes, and makes it possible to use it to
  generate Slonik scripts for tests in the "test bed," which has
  the further merit of making tools/configure-replication.sh a
  regularly-regression-tested tool.

<li> Fix to bug #15 - where long cluster name (>40 chars) leads to
  things breaking when an index name is created that contains
  the cluster name.

<ul>
  <li> Warn upon creating a long cluster name.
  <li> Give a useful exception that explains the cause rather
     than merely watching index creation fail.
</ul>

   See <a href="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15"> Bug #15 </a>

<li> Fix for bug #19 - added a script to help the administrator
  search for any triggers on the database that is the source for
  a schema that is to be used to initialize a log shipping node.

<p>  The problem is that some/most/sometimes all triggers and rules
  are likely to need to be dropped from the log shipping node lest
  they interfere with replication.

<li> Elimination of custom "xxid" functions

<P>  PostgreSQL 8.3 introduces a set of "txid" functions and a
  "txid_snapshot" type, which eliminates the need for Slony-I to have
  its own C functions for doing XID comparisons.

<P>  Note that this affects the structure of sl_event, and leads to some
  changes in the coding of the regression tests.

<P>  This eliminates the src/xxid directory and contents

<li> All of the interesting cleanup work is now done in the stored
  function, cleanupEvent(interval, boolean).

<P>  Interesting side-effect: You can now induce a cleanup manually,
  which will be useful for testing.

<li> cleanupEvent now has two parameters, passed in from slon config
  parameters:

<P>  interval - cleanup_interval (default '10 minutes')

<P>   This controls how quickly old events are trimmed out.  It used to
   be a hard-coded value.

<P>   Old events are trimmed out once the confirmations are aged by
   (cleanup_interval).

<P>   This then controls when the data in sl_log_1/sl_log_2 can be
   dropped.

<P>   Data in <i>those</i> tables is deleted when it is older than the
   earliest XID still captured in sl_event.

<p>  boolean - cleanup_deletelogs (default 'false')

<P>   This controls whether or not we DELETE data from sl_log_1/sl_log_2

<P>   By default, we now NEVER delete data from the log tables; we
   instead use TRUNCATE.

<li> We now consider initiating a log switch every time cleanupEvent()
  runs.

<P>  If the call to logswitch_finish() indicates that there was no log
  switch in progress, we initiate one.

<P>  This means that log switches will be initiated almost as often as
  possible.  That's a policy well worth debating :-).

<li> logswitch_finish() changes a fair bit...

<P>  It uses the same logic as in cleanupEvent() to determine if there
  are any *relevant* tuples left in sl_log_[whatever], rather than
  (potentially) scanning the table to see if there are any undeleted
  tuples left.

<li> At slon startup time, it logs (at SLON_CONFIG level) all of the
parameter values.  Per <a
href="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21"> Bugzilla
entry #21.</a>

<li> New slonik "CLONE PREPARE" and "CLONE FINISH" command to assist in
  creating duplicate nodes based on taking a copy of some existing
  subscriber node.

<li> We no longer use LISTEN/NOTIFY for events and confirmations, which
  eliminates the usage that has caused pg_listener bloat.  We instead
  poll against the event table.

<li> Various instances where slonik would use a default node ID of 1 have
  been changed to remove this.

<P>  Slonik scripts may need to be changed to indicate an EVENT NODE (or
  similar) after migration to v2.0 as a result.

<P>  The slonik commands involved:

<ul>
  <li> STORE NODE - EVENT NODE
  <li> DROP NODE - EVENT NODE
  <li> WAIT FOR EVENT - WAIT ON
  <li> FAILOVER - BACKUP NODE
  <li> EXECUTE SCRIPT - EVENT NODE
</ul>
<li> Fixed a problem where ACCEPT_SET would wait for the corresponding
  MOVE_SET or FAILOVER_SET to arrive while holding an exclusive lock
  on sl_config_lock, preventing the other remote worker to process
  that event.
</ul>

Slony-I 1.2.14 available
http://main.slony.info/downloads/1.2/source/slony1-1.2.14.tar.bz2
2008-05-16
Chris Browne

Version 1.2.14 has been released.  Changes include:
<ul>
<li> Fix typo in configure-replication.sh (missing CR)

<li> Per <a href="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35">bug #35,</a>
  search the Slony share dir for scripts before falling back to the PG
  share dir on 8.0+

 <p> This has resulted in quite a lot of discussion on bug #35; we
 <i>need</i> agreement that this change is an apropos way to go...
  
<li> Change test framework to write out the test name into
  $TEMPDIR/TestName

<li> Patch that seems to resolve a race condition with
  ACCEPT_SET

<li> Fix bug #49 - mishandling by slony_logshipper of quotes and
  backslashes.

<li> Fix bug #50 - slony_logshipper had a variable access <i>after</i>
  memory was freed

</ul>

Docs for 1.2.13 updated to include png, man pages
http://main.slony.info/downloads/1.2/source/slony1-1.2.13-docs.tar.bz2
2008-02-29
Chris Browne

Vivek Khera observed that the documentation tarball did not include
.png files or man pages; added this in, and rebuilt the tarball.

<P>There is no change to the source code tarball.
---
Slony-I 1.2.13 available
http://main.slony.info/downloads/1.2/source/slony1-1.2.13.tar.bz2
2008-02-09
Chris Browne

<ul>
<li> Fixed problem with compatibility with PostgreSQL 8.3; function
  typenameTypeId() has 3 arguments as of 8.3.

  <p> This now allows Slony-I to work with the PostgreSQL 8.3.0 release.

<li> Added in logic to ensure that max # of SYNCs grouped together is
  actually constrained by config parameter sync_group_maxsize.

<li> Fix to show_slony_configuration - point to proper directory where
  slon/slonik are actually installed.

<li> Fix to slonik Makefile + slonik.c - Change slonik build to query
  Postgres for the share directory at runtime - per Dave Page

<li> Removed spurious NOTIFY on "_%s_Confirm"; this is no longer needed
  in the 1.2 branch, as there is no LISTEN on this notification.
  Noted in <a href="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32"> bug #32</a>
</ul>
---
Slony-I Bugzilla available
http://bugs.slony.info/bugzilla/
2007-11-13
Christopher Browne

<P> Many thanks to Command Prompt staff for installing and configuring
a <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/"> Bugzilla</a> instance for use in
tracking Slony-I bugs and feature requests.

<P> Feature and bug lists will be migrating into this over the next
little while...

Slony-I 1.2.12 available
http://slony.info/downloads/1.2/source/slony1-1.2.12.tar.bz2
2007-11-12
Christopher Browne

<P> Version 1.2.12 is now released
<ul>
<li>Fixed problem with DDL SCRIPT parser where C-style comments were
  not being processed properly

<li>Added stored functions and documentation for adding empty tables
  (notably *partitions*) to replication.  Note these functions
  do no work when not specifically requested.

  CAVEAT:  This functionality may not work as expected on versions
  of PostgreSQL earlier than 8.1.  Mind you, partitioning tends
  to function pretty poorly in earlier versions of PostgreSQL as
  there were substantial enhancements in 8.1 and following versions.

<li>Added a fairly substantial partitioning test to exercise the
  new stored functions above.

<li>Backport "listen path" generator function from CVS HEAD (2.0) to
  1.2 branch.

<li>Fixed a problem with "EXECUTE SCRIPT" (introduced in remote_worker.c
  version 1.124.2.13) where moving the relevant code into a subroutine
  at the end led to losing the "BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL
  SERIALIZABLE;" query that needs to be the first thing run...

<li>Fixing the archive sequence generations (in log shipping).  All
  non-SYNC events must start the local transaction before creating the
  archive as well, so that the lock on the archive counter table
  serializes archive creation.

<li>Fixed logging done in local_listener.c - various places, there was
  no '\n' in some cases, which would lead to entries being folded
  together.

<li>Fix launch_slons.sh - was not stripping quotes from PID file name

<li>Error handling for "ERROR: could not serialize access due to
  concurrent update"

  <P> If this error is encountered when starting processing of
  sl_archive_counter, then two threads are fighting over access to
  this counter, and at least one has just failed.

  <P> Rather than waiting, we ask to restart the node immediately.

<li> Fixes to slonik_build_env script - it wasn't properly handling
  cases where there was just 1 table or 1 sequence, and had a
  problem with the -schema option - thanks, Bernd Helmle

<li> Don't bother building slony_logshipper on Win32 as it doesn't work
  there at this point.

<li> If slonik connects as other than a superuser, then generate error
  message indicating this to the user.
</ul>

Slony-I 1.2.11 released
http://slony.info/downloads/1.2/source/slony1-1.2.11.tar.bz2
2007-08-28
Christopher Browne

We are pleased to announce general availability of Slony-I 1.2.11.

<P> Fixes are the following:
<ul>
<li> Add in tools/mkservice scripts previously added to CVS HEAD

<li> During subscription, do UPDATE to pg_class.relhasindex *after* the
  TRUNCATE because, in 8.2+, TRUNCATE resets this attribute

<li> Fixed a problem with the setsync tracking with Log Shipping in cases
  where slon does an internal restart (thereby rereading the
  pset.ssy_seqno) and ignoring non-SYNC events because those don't
  change the sl_setsync table.

<li> More explicit type casting of text objects for compatibility with
  PostgreSQL 8.3

<li> Fixed problem with DDL SCRIPT statement parser: it wasn't 'quoting'
  semicolons inside parentheses (this notably occurs in CREATE RULE).

<li> Fixed problem with DDL SCRIPT statement submission; it was
  interpreting the statement as a format string, which would have
  ill effects in the presence of things that are interpreted such
  as format strings (%d, %f, %s) and \backslashed things like \\, \n.

<li> Further DDL Script issue: non-terminated statement at the end
  (e.g. - without trailing semicolon ";") would get omitted.

<li> Typo fix: when trying to disable a node, the logs would report
  "enableNode" rather than "disableNode".  Fixed.

<li> Add usage/version options to help output in slon.

<li> Fix archive logging for replicated sequences.

<li> Fix to log shipping - added another table, sl_archive_counter where
  the log writing slon simply tracks when it wrote the last offline
  archive file and maintains a counter. This counter is now tracked in
  the offline replica and must increment gap free.

<li> Change the filenames of archive logs to be based on internal archive
  tracking number.  This makes it easy for the mechanism applying
  archives to figure out what needs to be applied next - just look in
  sl_archive_tracking.

<li> Fix log shipping test to accomodate the new tracking scheme, and
  update documentation to describe this better.  
</ul>

Generating RPMS for Slony-I
http://slony.info/
2007-06-28
Devrim Gunduz

RPM "spec" files are a part of the Slony-I build; if you require RPMs
for your flavour of RPM-based distribution, try building Slony-I thus:

<pre>
./configure
make rpm
</pre>

For systems reasonably similar to Fedora and RHAS, this will generate
.rpm files that will be compatible with your system.

Slony-I 1.2.10 pre-release tarball #2 uploaded
http://lists.slony.info/downloads/1.2/source/slony1-1.2.10-pre2.tar.bz2
2007-06-21
Chris Browne

I have uploaded a tarball for 1.2.10 based on the fixes that have come
in this week to <a href=
"http://main.slony.info/documentation/logshipping.html"> log shipping
</a>.

<P> I have run tests of this build on Debian/Unstable on the IA-32
architecture against each of PostgreSQL 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, and a
recent copy of CVS HEAD (e.g. - 8.3).

<P> Please <i>do not</i> release binaries based on this tarball; that
could lead to the regrettable situation of people downloading
something that isn't the true final release of 1.2.10.  The license
permits such things, but <i>please</i> wait until we call this final...

Version 1.2.10 - log shipping problem to solve
http://lists.slony.info/pipermail/slony1-bugs/2007-June/000017.html
2007-06-12
Chris Browne

Alas, I found a problem with log shipping.  I wrote a test where I
surrounded a DDL_SCRIPT event with a series of STORE_TRIGGER events;
this led to a fairly wacky set of SYNC ID numbers getting generated.
(See the "testlogship" test in the tests area for details on the
test.)

<P> Well, comprehensively breaking it hopefully leads to a
comprehensive fix...

<P> In more positive news, the test called "testmultiplemoves" seems
to be working well, so there's more testing taking place than ever...

Version 1.2.10 testing still under way
http://main.slony.info/downloads/1.2
2007-06-11
Chris Browne

I have done further updates to documentation after discovering a
problem with compatibility of UPDATE FUNCTIONS with versions 8.1.0
thru 8.1.3.  Alas, you won't have much success running UPDATE
FUNCTIONS on those versions.

<P> Jan Wieck has made various casting changes throughout the code to
address a change in how version 8.3 handles the automatic casting of
string values.  This has resulted in my needing to run the latest CVS
thru a comprehensive set of cross-PG-version tests, again, because
there is a potential for this to break compatibility with elder
versions of PostgreSQL.  (Hopefully not, but we'd better test, hadn't
we...)

Slony-I Release - 1.2.7
http://main.slony.info/downloads/1.2
2007-03-07
Chris Browne
We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.2.7, which may be
found <a href="http://main.slony.info/downloads/1.2/source/slony1-1.2.7.tar.bz2">here</a>.  
There is also a <a href="http://main.slony.info/downloads/1.2/source/slony1-1.2.7-docs.tar.bz2">Documentation tarball </a>.

<P> This release fixes several problems that were found in the 1.2 stream:
<ul>
<li> Add remote_listen_timeout parameter to slon.conf

<p> This addresses the problem where a slon times out when accessing
sl_event if a node has been out of commission for a long time (several
days)

<li> Resolve bug #1623

<p> In this bug, big "action lists" that need to get compressed could cause
a logging printf to blow up.  Changed the logging level so that detail
is only shown at level 4, which won't bite people by default.

<li> UNINSTALL NODE failures now show node # in slonik error messages

<P> If a user ran several UNINSTALL NODE requests in a single slonik
script, and one of them broke, you'd have no ready way to tell which
node this failed on.  Added code to report the node # where it failed.

<li> Added test to test1 for function generate_sync_event() and make_function_strict

<li> Added "v81" files (for slony1_base.v81.sql, slony1_funcs.v81.sql,
xxid.v81.sql), necessary to support 8.1 "ALTER FUNCTION ... STRICT";

<li> Fixed quoting problem in generate_sync_event()

<li> Added functionality to UPDATE FUNCTIONS to make xxidin() function
STRICT; the absence of this caused postmaster to fall over when
processing MOVE SET event in PG v8.2

<li> Added documentation of an issue surrounding NULLABLE columns to the
log analysis chapter of the admin guide and to the UPGRADING docs.

<li> When you run MOVE SET, this populates sl_setsync for the moved set
  even on nodes that are not subscribed.  If, subsequent to doing this, 
  you attempt a SUBSCRIBE SET for a formerly-unsubscribed node, the
  subscription will fail right at the end when the slon tries to insert a
  new value to sl_setsync.

<P>   The fix: DELETE from sl_setsync immediately before the INSERT.  This
  will silently blow away any 'offending' sl_setsync row.

<p>  (As observed by Afilias staff...)

<li> Log shipping fix - storage of sl_setsync_offline call had a wrong
  printf type; change from %d to %s
</ul>

Slony-I Release - 1.1.7
http://main.slony.info/downloads/1.1
2007-03-07
Chris Browne
We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.1.7, which may be
found <a href="http://main.slony.info/downloads/1.1/source/slony1-1.1.7.tar.bz2">here</a>.  
It fixes several problems that were found in the 1.2 stream that were readily back-ported to 1.1:
<ul>
<li>Add remote_listen_timeout parameter to <tt>slon.conf</tt>

<p> This addresses the problem where a slon times out when accessing
sl_event if a node has been out of commission for a long time (several
days)

<li> Add node numbers to error reports in slonik

<p> If portions of UNINSTALL NODE break, report in the error message which node
it was working on.  That way the gentle user gets an indication as to 
which node 'broke' if the slonik script contained multiple such
requests.

<li> Applied bug fix for #1538

<p> If cluster has only one node, then remove all events up to the last
SYNC.  That allows the cleanup loop to clear out sl_log_{1/2}.
Otherwise, the log tables will forever bloat until you add a second
node...

<li> Added test to test1 for function generate_sync_event() and make_function_strict

<li> Added "v81" files (for slony1_base.v81.sql, slony1_funcs.v81.sql,
xxid.v81.sql), necessary to support 8.1 "ALTER FUNCTION ... STRICT";

<li> Fixed quoting problem in generate_sync_event()

<li> Added functionality to UPDATE FUNCTIONS to make xxidin() function
STRICT; the absence of this caused postmaster to fall over when
processing MOVE SET event in PG v8.2 (not to say that Slony-I 1.1 now
*supports* 8.2; it does not)

<li> When you run MOVE SET, this populates sl_setsync for the moved set
  even on nodes that are not subscribed.  If, subsequent to doing this, 
  you attempt a SUBSCRIBE SET for a formerly-unsubscribed node, the
  subscription will fail right at the end when the slon tries to insert a
  new value to sl_setsync.

<p>  The fix: DELETE from sl_setsync immediately before the INSERT.  This
  will silently blow away any 'offending' sl_setsync row.

<P>  (As observed by Afilias staff...)

<li> Log shipping fix - storage of sl_setsync_offline call had a wrong
  printf type; change from %d to %s
