          <h1>Web Site and CVS</h1>

          <p>The Slony-I web site physically resides at path
          <tt>/home/community/slony/htdocs</tt> , and is an
          anonymous checkout of the <tt>slony1-www</tt> <a href=
          "cvs.html">CVS repository.</a></p>

          <p>As a result, if you make changes directly, you'll want
          to do a <tt>cvs diff</tt> to extract those changes, and
          apply them to some not-so-anonymous copy of CVS that you
          have access to. Then please commit such changes to CVS
          and see about doing a <tt>cvs update</tt> in the
          <tt>htdocs</tt> directory to deploy those changes "to
          production."</p>

          <h1>Backups</h1>

          <p>Both <tt>rsync</tt> and <tt>unison</tt> are installed;
          either may be used to backup important parts of the web
          site.</p>

          <p>Here are the contents of a set of Unison <tt>.prf</tt>
          files suitable for backing up CVS, mailing lists, and the
          local web site contents.</p>

          <h2>Usage</h2>

          <p>If you are using Unison, you might write the above
          files into your local <tt>${HOME}/.unison</tt> directory,
          and then use them as follows:</p>
          <pre>
cd ${HOME}.unison
for target in `ls cmd*prf | cut -d "." -f 1`; do
   unison ${target}
done
</pre>

          <p>By default, this will request user intervention to
          indicate the direction in which to propagate updates; if
          you know what you're doing, you can tell
          <tt>unison</tt>to "just do it."</p>

          <h2>Other Environmental Stuff</h2>

          <p>Those with login access, please add the entry:</p>
          <pre>
umask 0002
</pre>

          <p>to your <tt>.profile</tt> / <tt>.bashrc</tt> file.
          That way, <i>group write</i> is permitted, by default.
          It's very annoying, particularly in the web site area, if
          one person checks out CVS with <tt>umask 0022</tt>,
          thereby forbidding anyone else from updating any files
          that they newly add.</p>

          <h1>Editing the Web Site</h1>

          <p>Niels Breet has set things up where there is a pair of
          central PHP scripts, <tt>index.php</tt>, and
          <tt>layout.php</tt>, which control rendering of the site.
          By doing things this way, each page on the site can have a
          common layout complete with common
          header/footer/graphics.</p>

          <p>Web site <i>content</i> resides in the
          <tt>content</tt> directory as a set of <tt>.txt</tt>
          files.</p>

          <p>These pages consist of some lightly formatted
          material:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>There is a "title" on the first line;</li>

            <li>There is a URL for that title on the second line;
	    </li>

            <li>Following that is a set of HTML text that
            will be rendered as the body of the web page</li>
          </ul>

          <p>There are also some pages that consist of
          lightly-formatted news material, such as
          <tt>news.txt</tt>. This file consists of a set of news
          items, formatted thus:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>A line consisting of "---"</li>

            <li>A title for the item</li>

            <li>A URL for that title to point at (<i>e.g.</i> - if
            you click on the title, you head to the URL)</li>

            <li>A possibly-multi-line chunk of HTML to describe the
            piece of news.</li>

            <li>A line consisting of "---"</li>
          </ul>
