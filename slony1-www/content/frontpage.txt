Why use Slony-I when PostgreSQL 9.0 includes replication?

<P> PostgreSQL 9.0 includes streaming replication, which, for a number
of use cases, is likely to be simpler and more convenient than
Slony-I.

<P> There are, however, three characteristic kinds of cases where
you'll need something like Slony-I, where the built-in WAL-based
replication won't work:

<ul>

<li> You need to interact between PostgreSQL versions.  Slony (and
   similar systems like Londiste and Bucardo) can cope with having
   nodes running different versions of PostgreSQL.

<P> WAL-based replication requires that all databases use
   <i>identical</i> versions of PostgreSQL, running on identical
   architectures.

<li> You only want to replicate parts of the changes that are going on.

<P>  WAL-based replication duplicates <i>absolutely everything.</i>

<li> You need for there to be extra behaviours taking place on
   subscribers, for instance, populating cache management information.

<p> WAL-based replication duplicates <i>absolutely everything,</i> and
   nothing extra that changes data can run on a WAL-based replica.

</ul>

<P> Steve Singer also discusses the matter in <a href=
"http://scanningpages.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/9-0-streaming-replication-vs-slony/">
9.0 Streaming Replication vs Slony </a>.

<P> As observed up front, the streaming replication built into PostgreSQL,
which has progressed since its beginnings in version 8.1, can satisfy
some users' replication requirements.  For those with requirements that
are not compatible with its strictures, replication systems like Slony-I
will continue to be useful.

Slony-I 2.0.5 Released

<P> 2.0.5 fixes more than 24 issues found from 2.0.4 and earlier versions, remedying many issues found during an extensive testing period.

Slony-I Migrated to Git

<p> Slony-I source code has been migrated to use <a
href="http://www.git-scm.org/"> Git.</a></p>

<p> There are several addresses at which one may get at the repository
via the various protocols that Git supports:
	      
<ul>
	      <li><tt>git://git.postgresql.org/git/slony1-engine.git</tt></li>
	      <li><tt>http://git.postgresql.org/git/slony1-engine.git</tt></li>
	      <li><tt>ssh://git@git.postgresql.org/slony1-engine.git</tt></li>
</ul>

<P> At present, we do not have a way to automatically send email out
when changes are committed (as was the case with CVS).  There is,
however, an automatically generated <a href=
"http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=slony1-engine.git;a=rss"> RSS feed
</a>.

Slony-I 2.0.2 Released

<P> See the "news" area for more details, including a copy of the
release notes.  This version fixes quite a number of issues found in
early use of version 2.0.

<P> See the "news" area for more details, including a copy of the
release notes.  This version fixes issues relating to FAILOVER.

<P> Source RPMs (SRPMs) are available <a href=

early use of version 2.0.0.

Slony-I 2.0.0 Released

<P> See the "news" area for more details, including a copy of the release
notes.

<P> This is a <i>major</i> new release of Slony-I; it makes use of
some features introduced in PostgreSQL 8.3, and hence is not
compatible with versions older than 8.3.

<P> This is considered a pretty good tradeoff, as various
functionality would not be possible with earlier versions of
PostgreSQL.
<ul>
<li> Internal catalogues are no longer "hacked with," so that you may, with the new version, use pg_dump against subscribers and be able to expect to have a complete and consistent dump.
<li> Trigger handling is <i>enormously</i> cleaner.
</ul>

<P> Unfortunately, it needs to be noted that there is not, as of yet,
an upgrade procedure to upgrade an installation of Slony-I 1.2.x to
2.0.  At present, upgrading to 2.0 will essentially require dropping
out replication and recreating it.

<P> We hope to have an answer as to how to deal with this in the new year.

<P> Follow <a href=
"http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69"> Bug #69 </a> for
more details on this.

Checking Cluster State

<p> People frequently ask for assistance in figuring out what might be
wrong with their cluster.  The <em>first thing</em> that you should do
if you think there <em>might</em> be a problem (or even if you don't)
is to run the <a href=
"http://slony.info/documentation/monitoring.html#TESTSLONYSTATE"> test
state </a> scripts.  That may help point you to where the problem is;
it may also help point other would-be helpers to where the problem is.

<p> If you're not running these scripts hourly against your
cluster(s), you really should be...

Slony-I and PostgreSQL 8.1
#
          <p>There is a known incompatibility of versions earlier
          than 1.1.5 with version 8.1; you can expect to see the
          following error message when compiling:</p>
          <em>
slony1_funcs.c:1081: error: too many arguments to function
`Async_Unlisten' 
</em>

          <p>A patch for both version 1.1 "STABLE" and CVS HEAD has
          been committed to CVS; look at both CVS HEAD as well as
          <tt>REL_1_1_STABLE</tt>. It is in the 1.1.5 release
          candidate described above.</p>

Upgrading Slony-I
#
          <p>Beginning with version 1.0.5 the slon replication
          engine refuses to work against any database that does not
          have the stored procedures for the same version loaded or
          where the shared object containing the C language support
          functions and the log trigger does not match the version
          number.</p>

          <p>This means that the Slony installation on all nodes in
          a cluster must be upgraded at once.</p>

          <p>The proper upgrade procedure is this:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Stop the slon replication engine on all nodes.</li>

            <li>Install the new Slony version on all nodes.</li>

            <li>Execute a slonik script containing the command
              <pre>

    update functions (id = );
</pre>for every node in the cluster.
            </li>

            <li>Start all slon replication engines.</li>
          </ol>

Libpq requirements
#
          <p>The multithreaded replication engine requires the
          libpq client library to be compiled with
          --enable-thread-safety on certain operating systems.
          Known are thus far Solaris and AIX. Other operating
          systems are known to not require this (Linux-X86,
          FreeBSD-X86, FreeBSD-Alpha, OpenBSD-Sparc64 and OSX). The
          configuration script is broken with respect to the
          --enable-thread-safety switch for Solaris. Please apply
          this patch, configure and recompile libpq: <a href=
