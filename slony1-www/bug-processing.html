		<h1>Slony-I Bug Processing</h1>
			
		<p> Slony bug tracking is being managed using <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/"> Bugzilla.</a></p>
			
		<p> Here is the <a href="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/"> Slony-I
		Bugzilla Instance </a>.</p>

		<h1> Bug Management Process </h1>

		<p> <a href="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/docs/en/html/lifecycle.html"> Bug
		Lifecycle Documentation </a> uses the following image <img src="http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/docs/en/images/bzLifecycle.png" alt="">
		to characterize the flow of work on bugs, through various states, as
		they (hopefully!) get fixed.</p>

		<p> The following interpretations are suggested.</p>

		<h2> NEW </h2>
		<a name="NEW"></a>

		<p> When a bug is created, it is created with <b>NEW</b> state, is
		assigned to <tt>slony1-bugs@lists.slony.info</tt>, and an email is
		sent to the bug tracking list.</p>

		<p> At this point, someone on the Slony development team should
		examine the bug to ascertain what, if anything, should be done with
		it.</p>

		<p> It may be appropriate to:</p>
		<ul>

		<li> Assign it to someone that is expected to work on it, changing the
		owner, and change the status to <a href="#ASSIGNED">ASSIGNED</a>.</li>

		<li> Perhaps the bug is trivially resolved, in which case, it is
		reasonable to jump straight to marking it <a href="#RESOLVED">RESOLVED</a>.</li>

		<li> Perhaps the bug is invalid.  Jump straight to <a href="#RESOLVED">RESOLVED</a>.</li>

		<li> Perhaps it is unclear who should work on it.  Perhaps the bug
		should be left alone, or perhaps it should be <a href="#ASSIGNED">ASSIGNED</a> to someone who might know who
		<i>should</i> do the work.</li>
		</ul>

		</ul>

		<h2> ASSIGNED </h2>
		  <a name="ASSIGNED"></a>

		<p> This is the state of bugs that belong to <i>someone</i>.  That
		someone should presumably be a human, and not
		<tt>slony1-bugs@lists.slony.info</tt>.</p>

		<h2> RESOLVED </h2>
		  <a name="RESOLVED"></a>

		<p> This is the state of bugs that have been addressed, after some
		fashion.</p>

		<p> There are several possible resolutions:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> <b>FIXED</b> - believed to be resolved</li>
		<li> <b>DUPLICATE</b> - this apparently duplicates some previous bug</li>
		<li> <b>WONTFIX</b> - a problem that we don't plan to address</li>
		<li> <b>WORKSFORME</b> - the developer can't duplicate the issue</li>
		<li> <b>INVALID</b> - the problem is considered part of the proper behaviour of Slony</li>
		</ul>

		<p> Note that this is <i>not the end</i> of the lifecycle!</p>

		<p> If a developer has a patch for a complex issue, it is appropriate to:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> Attach a patch, or perhaps a reference to a Git commit for the proposed fix.</li>
		<li> Mark the bug <b>RESOLVED/FIXED</b></li>
		<li> Reassign the bug, either to:
		  <ul>
		    <li> The person that reported the bug</li>
		    <li> The <tt>slony1-bugs@lists.slony.info</tt> user</li>
		    <li> A specific Slony developer that is to validate the fix as <a name="#VERIFIED"> VERIFIED</a></li>
		  </ul></li>
		</ul>

		<h2> VERIFIED </h2>
		  <a name="VERIFIED"></a>

		<p> A developer (or user) takes a <a href="#RESOLVED">RESOLVED</a> bug, and evaluates
		whether the resolution provided is proper.</p>

		<p> The same resolution values apply:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> <b>FIXED</b> - believed to be resolved</li>
		<li> <b>DUPLICATE</b> - this apparently duplicates some previous bug</li>
		<li> <b>WONTFIX</b> - a problem that we don't plan to address</li>
		<li> <b>WORKSFORME</b> - the developer can't duplicate the issue</li>
		<li> <b>INVALID</b> - the problem is considered part of the proper behaviour of Slony</li>
		</ul>

		<p> At this point, for complex patches, we can consider that the patch
		has been <b>verified</b> to be valid to be committed and released.</p>

		<p> The bug might be re-assigned back to the original developer to do
		the commit.  But wait, it's not <a href="#CLOSED">CLOSED</a> yet...</p>

		<h2> CLOSED </h2>
		  <a name="CLOSED"></a>

		<p> The final destination for a Slony bug is for it to be closed.  The
		fix should have passed through phases of being <a href="#ASSIGNED">
		ASSIGNED</a> <a href="#RESOLVED"> RESOLVED</a> <a name="#VERIFIED">
		VERIFIED</a>.  For particularly simple bugs, or for issues considered
		to <i>not really be bugs</i>, these phases may be rather brief.</p>

		<p> A bug being marked <b>CLOSED</b> should indicate that we have put
		it into some specific release, and placed a suitable reference into
		the release notes.</p>

		<h2> REOPENED </h2>

		<p> Oh, no, the <b>zombie bug!</b></p>

		<p> Sometimes bugs aren't solved in the first attempt, and need to be
		reopened.  This is pretty much equivalent to <a href="#ASSIGNED">
		ASSIGNED</a>.</p>

		<h1> Alternative Perspective </h1>

		<p> Here is how one might expect a typical bug to pass through
		the system.</p>

		<ul>

			  <li> Bug is reported on the mailing list</li>

			  <li> Developer copies this over to Bugzilla, creating a
			  <a href="#NEW"> NEW</a> bug.</li>

			  <li> Developer is reviewing the bug list, and sees a bug
				they wish to claim.  They change its status to <a
				  href="#ASSIGNED"> ASSIGNED</a>, and assign themself as the
				owner.

			  <li> Work continues apace.  

			  <li> The developer has a proposed patch, which is
				assigned to its own Git "topic branch" on their
				repository.

				<p> The developer attaches a link to this patch, or
				perhaps a copy of the patch, to the bug, and marks it
				<a href="#RESOLVED"> RESOLVED+FIXED</a>

			  <li> Some verification takes place.  Ideally, another
				developer confirms that the fix does what it ought to.
				Perhaps additional changes go into the patch.

			  <li> Consensus is arrived at that the patch is good to
				go into one or more branches of Slony-I.
				<ul>
				  
				  <li> The patch is applied to those branches, and
				  committed.
				  
				  <li> Notes about the bug are added to the release
				  notes, and committed.  

				  <li> They add indication to the bug of application
				  of the changes, so readers know what version(s) of
				  Slony-I may be expected to have this fix.

				  <li> The bug is marked <a href="#CLOSED">
					  CLOSED.</a>
					
				</ul>
			</ul>
