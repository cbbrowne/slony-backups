* slony.info Backups

  This repository contains backup tools and backups of material from
  [[http://slony.info][slony.info]].

  - Mail archives :: The slony.info site runs Mailman; the script
                     pulls monthly material.
  - Bugzilla :: The script pulls all available bugs as web pages,
                along with summary pages of all bugs that are "open"
                and all bugs that are "closed."

** How does it run?

   There are a pair of scripts, ~Slony-Archive-Bugzilla.sh~ and
   ~Slony-Archive-Mail.sh~.

   These scripts are run on one of Chris' computers via ~crontab~ on a
   daily basis, and they pull the latest data into a checkout of this
   repository, check it in, and push it up to GitHub.
