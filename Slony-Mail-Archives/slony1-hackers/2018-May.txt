I did see this, I haven't yet had time to look at the patches.
It is on my list.

That seemed like something I shouldn?t override with a customization. Re: snprintf, that seems like a good improvement. I see snprintf can also truncate output, so I?ll need to account for that as well with a rewrite.

I've looked over the patch.
It looks fine (I've changed some indentation)

I am okay merging this https://github.com/ssinger/slony1-engine/tree/akamai 
into master.

However we do need to also update the admin guide to describe the new 
options.

	Great! Thank you. I can write up something for the options. I'll find config options in the existing doc and come up with something similar. Let me know if there's anything else I should do.
	What version do you expect these changes to first appear in?

	Hi Steve,
	How about this for options? After looking about, it seems these could go into I. Reference ? slon ? Connection settings.

remote_listen_serializable_transactions (boolean)

Determines if the remote listener should use serializable transactions. True by default.
This setting trades between strict isolation and avoiding blocking for lock management.

enable_version_check (boolean)

Determines if services should check release versions and fail when versions are not identical. True by default.
This setting may be disabled during upgrades when the starting and target versions are known to be compatible.

        I've looked over the patch.
        It looks fine (I've changed some indentation)
        
        I am okay merging this https://github.com/ssinger/slony1-engine/tree/akamai 
        into master.
        
        However we do need to also update the admin guide to describe the new 
        options.

As I understand the issues, there is a choice to either maintain or assign away the Akamai copyright for the code I wrote.  Per our previous discussion, we?re maintaining the Akamai copyright. This is accomplished by header comments and/or some meta-data in the patch. If the header comment is a problem, then the patch meta-data becomes essential. If slony1-hackers can agree on exactly what copyright changes are needed, I can take them back to Akamai opensource.

That seemed like something I shouldn?t override with a customization. Re: snprintf, that seems like a good improvement. I see snprintf can also truncate output, so I?ll need to account for that as well with a rewrite.
