It depends on the Slony version you are using.

Since version 2.0 DDL "may" be executed safely against any node in the 
cluster. There is no problem with the system catalog any more, like 
prior to 2.0. But it should be obvious that certain changes can lead to 
problems later on. Having extra columns on a master for example would 
break replication while extra columns on a subscriber are no problem, as 
long as you never move the set to it. Foreign keys are NOT enforced 
during replication, so additional FK on a subscriber would eventually 
lead to trouble when you move set or make that node a stand alone DB.
