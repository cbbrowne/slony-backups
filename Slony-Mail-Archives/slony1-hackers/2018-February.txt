Yes that is fine.

This patch seems good  other than the copyright notice issue we've 
discussed. Also we probably should add something to the doc/adminguide 
documenting this.

How do you feel about instead having an option to disable the slony version 
check.

My concern with saying all 2.2.x versions are compatible or even that 
certain minor/patch versions are compatible is the cross version testing 
load it puts on slony maintainers and how it might restrict things in the 
future.

If instead we just provide a option to disable the version check users can 
use this option as they see fit.

Per our previous discussion, we?re maintaining the Akamai copyright. This is accomplished by header comments and/or some meta-data in the patch. If the header comment is a problem, then the patch meta-data becomes essential. If slony1-hackers can agree on exactly what copyright changes are needed, I can take them back to Akamai opensource.

That seemed like something I shouldn?t override with a customization. Re: snprintf, that seems like a good improvement. I see snprintf can also truncate output, so I?ll need to account for that as well with a rewrite.

	Hi Steve and slony-hackers,
	Sure, I see how that simplifies maintainability going forward, and it?s fine for us to use a version check disable option.
	Thus far I?ve noted this change, the use of snprintf with the pg_home setting and the removal of copyright headers. I have another deadline this week so I?ll look to provide updated patches in the week following.
