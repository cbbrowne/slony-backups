Subject: [Slony1-hackers] missing dstring_terminate
Message-ID: <4FA1AD39.6010004@ca.afilias.info>

I think we are calling dstring_data on some strings in remote_worker.c 
that are built up with _append and don't have a termination call on them.

https://github.com/ssinger/slony1-engine/commit/e98a0567a32c81a635aff56c44b1eb45e7b4da16

Maybe the terminate would be done in the remote helper when we are 
finished building each string but I wasn't confident on where in the 
remote helper this should go.  The while loop was big and had a few 
breaks in it.  I am more confident in the correctness of putting this here.

Is my reasoning correct?
