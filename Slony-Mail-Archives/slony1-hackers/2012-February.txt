Yes, the documentation build includes a PG Autodoc-generated set of
schema documentation.

Sorry for the earlier reaction, I should have read Makefile first.

(That said, there are some sgml errors on 2.1.1, that prevents docs to
be built)

No that is not normal.
Set the environment variable  pghost to something that will Connect to a pgsql database. Pgport and pguser might need to bet set as well. Slony has required this for as long as I can remember.

	again
Message-ID: <1329392482.63506.YahooMailNeo@web29805.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've got 1 master and 3 slaves. I am using Slony 1.2.22.

We are in Production and for one of the slaves we decided to remove a few tables from replication only on one slave.
So the same tables will be replicated on the two others slaves.

I had a look on Slony documentation at http://slony.info/documentation/1.2/dropthings.html and I came to the conclusion
that it shoud be possible to do it using the "old way"

I mean using sections # 15.4.2 and # 15.5 to do something like BUT ONLY ON THIS SLAVE NOT ON THE TWO OTHER SLAVES


select _slonyschema.alterTableRestore(40); select _slonyschema.tableDropKey(40); delete from _slonyschema.sl_table where tab_id = 40;

We can not drop the set and build the subscription because it takes a lot of time to build subscription for the entire set. We are on production and our clients are connected.


Feel free to tell me if this method is safety.

Thanks.

Kind regards.

This is, in an important sense, corrupting the cluster, because the
configuration of the cluster considers all of those tables to be
subscribed by all the nodes.  If you need to do any switching around
of nodes (e.g. - moving master, or shuffling around subscriptions to
point to different sources), the fact that sl_table+sl_set have one
picture of things, whilst the triggers have another, will make the
cluster mighty fragile.

What I would do in this case is to separate these few tables into a
separate replication set, and only replicate that set to certain
nodes.

That's easiest if you create the two sets in the beginning.

create set (id = 1, origin=1, comment = ' set for most of the tables
subscribed everywhere');
set add table (id = 1, set id = 1, ...)
set add table (id = 2, set id = 1, ...)

create set (id = 2, origin=1, comment='set for the tables that only
need to be replicated to a few nodes');
set add table (id = 20, set id = 2, ...)
set add table (id = 21, set id = 2, ...)

If you're doing "surgery" after the fact, that is, if you only have
set #1 with all the tables, what I would do is...

- Create the new set
   create set (id = 2, origin=1, comment='set for the tables that only
need to be replicated to a few nodes');

- Subscribe it everywhere that set #1 is subscribed.  It has to have
*identical* subscriptions.
   (Yes, it's empty at the moment.  That's OK.)

e.g.:
  subscribe set (id=2, provider=1, receiver=2, forward=yes);
  subscribe set (id=2, provider=1, receiver=3, forward=yes);
  subscribe set (id=2, provider=2, receiver=4, forward=yes);
  subscribe set (id=2, provider=1, receiver=5, forward=yes);

Next, shift the tables that you want partially replicated into set #2
  set move table (origin=1, id=40, new set=2);
  set move table (origin=1, id=41, new set=2);

SET MOVE TABLE will refuse to shift the table to the new set unless
the subscription lists for the two sets are identical.

Once the tables are separated into the second set, you can remove the
subscriptions for set #2 that aren't needed.

Thus, supposing those tables are only needed by nodes 2 and 3, but not
by nodes 4 or 5, you can drop the subscriptions:

unsubscribe set (id=2, receiver=4);
unsubscribe set (id=2, receiver=5);

That's the clean way to handle this.

Christopher

I did a few test using your method and it works like a charm.

I wrote a small article on my blog about your method http://www.davidgis.fr/blog/index.php?2012/02/18/880-dropping-replicated-tables-and-sequences-for-only-one-slave-node

Tomorrow - at work -, I will try to use it with our datas? and will let you know :)

Thanks.

Kind regards.

David.

	from/to replication
Message-ID: <1330221419.10569.YahooMailNeo@web29802.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi

I use Slony 1.2.22

Replication: 1 master and 3 slaves.

We are used to update our Production Database every 2 or 3 months.

Updating Production Database 


- is done on a week-end. There is no connexion from client (rejected) only master and all slaves

can connect each other.

- implies to use DDL query on tables (alter table add ....and so on).

For the moment and for each update, we are used to build replication from scratch.
I know it is not a good way.


"Slony command DDL"? can not be used because it will take to much time and we've got a lot of replicated tables.
I am afraid that window of week-end will be not enough.


For the next update, what I would like to suggest to my team? ( and we will have the intention to test if I can convice them) is 


1)? removing all tables - to be altered -? from replication using set drop table(origin=??,id=??)

2) apply all DDL queries to the future altered table ( usual way : psql ....database)


3)? back all altered tables to replication :
???????? - create set (...)
???????? - set add table(...) to new set
??????? - merge set (new set to the old set associated to the altered table).

Can we do that??

There is no concurrent activity and we've got the window of the week-end.

Thanks for your reply.

I assume the problem is that you have a lot of tables and that the time 
slony takes to remove the replication triggers on each table in 
execute_script is to long. You should plan an upgrade to 2.x since execute 
script no longer does this.

I don't see any reason why that wouldn't work. You would need to subscribe 
the subscribers to the new set before you do the merge set.  This will cause 
the tables on the subscriber to be truncated and re-populated.  As always, 
you should make sure you do proper 'wait for events' so the subscribe doesn't 
happen before all of the subscriber has seen the drop table.
