Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Bug 375 - drop node
Message-ID: <584C2E72.6030103@ca.afilias.info>

I attached a patch to bug 375 about a month ago. 
(http://bugs.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=375)

Does anyone have any comments on it?
Objections to committing it or better ideas to fix the issue.  Jan ? 
Chris?  Anyone else?


The patch adds  DELETE statements for sl_seqlog and sl_log_script to 
dropNode_int
