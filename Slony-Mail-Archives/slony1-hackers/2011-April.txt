Subject: [Slony1-hackers] automatic wait for update
Message-ID: <4D961D0E.2020104@ca.afilias.info>

An update for anyone following the progress of this feature.

I had sent some emails about implementing a slon-side wait so where we 
would record pre-condition events from other nodes. We've had some 
in-person discussions off list and have decided to go this route.

This leaves a handful of issues that the current ('wait until the next 
event node is caught up with the previous event node') approach.

In particular events that can be submitted at an arbitrary node such as

DROP NODE:
-We should wait for ALL pending non-sync events (from all nodes) to be 
confirmed by all nodes (other than the one being dropped) before 
submitting the drop node.  Otherwise an earlier event such as a 'store 
path' or even a subscribe involving the 'dropped' node might arrive at a 
fourth node after the drop node. This isn't a critical error in that the 
'new' row in sl_node will be an <event pending> node but that row will 
never go away and I think this will confuse people.

STORE SET:
-Can conflict with DROP SET, I drop a set from one event node/origin 
then create a set with the same id at a different node.  A third node 
might see the STORE before the DROP.   Before submitting a STORE SET we 
should make sure all outstanding non-sync events have been confirmed by 
all nodes.

A source of both of these problems is that we allow node and set id's to 
be reused.  Since I have no appetite to change that I think what I 
discuss above is the best option.  It does mean that you can't drop 
nodes or create new sets if you have another node that is behind.  If 
that is your situation you can always disable the auto-wait for feature 
and hope your behind node processes things in the right order.

There might be a few more cases that need this type of behaviour but I 
haven't pinpointed them yet.

Subject: [Slony1-hackers] EEk. Remember to SQUASH those merges!
Message-ID: <BANLkTin5AY9MtCQxOtJg5oPPe8Zs9GGnzQ@mail.gmail.com>

I just merged in the fix for bug #196, and that pretty well spammed the list.

Note for next time: Remember to squash the commits together when
merging, because the bits of development that took place usually
aren't terribly much of interest, only, rather, the results.

Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Release notes updated
Message-ID: <BANLkTikMizf_cF-vccqzoyB71eDrg0juOw@mail.gmail.com>

I just did a walk-thru of the Git logs since the time of the Git
cutover, making sure everything that was done on HEAD was documented
in the release notes.

http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=slony1-engine.git;a=commit;h=ba0be2c14e49d4325ebc886977f3c0cbc3a346d1

As a bit of divergence from past practice, I added a list of all the
bugs that were multiply applied to HEAD as well as to other branches.
There are 23 thus far, which is rather a lot.  If anyone hates that,
I'll be happy to drop them, but it seems like a not-half-bad idea to
me to include this list.

I also added some notes about changes that didn't involve bugs that
were still changed.  Our normal practice should be to set up a bug in
Bugzilla for anything that we're changing (and I'm sometimes guilty of
not doing so myself).

Note that with some *trivial* formatting changes (specifically,
tossing prefix of * or ** against titles/subtitles), it's easy for
this listing to be processed using the Emacs Org-Mode
<http://orgmode.org/>, which enables transforming the notes into quite
"pretty" form in several formats including prettier text and HTML.
The latter would be quite useful for inclusion on the web site.

I'll attach samples of both text and HTML.  I'd be *slightly* inclined
to create a Makefile rule which spawns Emacs to read the release notes
and generates an .html and .txt file.  Not necessarily something vi
lovers will love, but I didn't say I'm *certainly* doing this :-).

1 Version To Be Determined, probably 2.1.0 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.1 Some items without bug numbers: 
====================================
  - Introduced tests using the clustertest framework, consisting of two
    sets of tests:
    - clustertest/regression - port of the old tests in the tests directory
    - clustertest/disorder - new simulated order entry system with a fair bit of concurrency

  - Configure and Makefile cleanups and improvements, including
    - Configure looks in common locations for some of the DocBook
      tooling, so it is less likely to require manual intervention on
      some common distributions
    - Pick up Groff automagically
    - Script to do virtually all the work documented in the [Release Checklist]
  - Documentation updates
    - Reorganized sections
    - Trend towards having version-specific documentation, rather than
      trying to have it document all versions at once
  - Git changes
    - Numerous .gitignore files set up to ignore generated files

Subject: [Slony1-hackers] patches related to bug196
Message-ID: <4DAF5492.20007@ca.afilias.info>

There are three patches living in my auto-waitfor branch at
git://github.com/ssinger/slony1-engine.git  that are related to the 
bug196 (sl_event_lock) changes that should probably be merged into master.

(The last one in this list is really a pre-existing bug but the lock 
changes seem to make it much more likely to have deadlock).




commit d85d1a6b802d00e8de40ee5a25fb7f35b95b1c3c
Author: Steve Singer <ssinger at ca.afilias.info>
Date:   Tue Apr 19 10:23:35 2011 -0400

     Do not lock sl_event when adding an event.
     The caller should already have a lock on sl_event_lock
     which must be obtained before the txid is assigned



commit 58117f3f15c69ac3cc35c8fec112bb66260d9ef1
Author: Steve Singer <ssinger at ca.afilias.info>
Date:   Tue Apr 19 10:24:30 2011 -0400

     Obtaining this lock actually increases deadlock because
     it creates a conflict between sl_config_lock and sl_event_lock.

     slonik initiated queries will always obtain sl_event_lock before
     sl_config_lock (or at least when creating events).  Having
     remote_worker do the opposite isn't a good idea.

     If we find more examples of deadlock with this removed then
     they need to be adressed in some other fashion.

commit cd7759ed75ae3ee02f08f497556296b628153df7
Author: Steve Singer <ssinger at ca.afilias.info>
Date:   Wed Apr 20 17:40:53 2011 -0400

     Fixing an issues where slon would try to start a new transaction
     and obtain sl_config_lock instead of calling enableSubscription.
     This was causing a deadlock with sl_event_lock during some
     tests

I have started taking a poke at reviewing the auto-wait-for branch,
notably with a first pass thru the docs.  I suggest pulling recent
patches from my branch, as I did a moderate chunk of wordsmithing.
Amusing that I haven't validated that the *code* works yet, but by
poking at the docs, I have a better idea of what the code is
*intended* to do :-).
