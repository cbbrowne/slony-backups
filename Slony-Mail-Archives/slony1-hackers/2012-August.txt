Hi,

I have to do a maintenance on a replicated table. We found that a foreign key have been added on the replicated table.

Instead of using DDL execute script, I am used to do 

- removing table from replication

- doing my altered queries

- putting back table into replication.

Since the replicated table has a small size and since my altered query is 

alter table ... add constraint ... foreign key? ... references ....(....);

I asked myself if the 3 steps above are mandatory ( or "DDl execute script")? or if I can execute my altered query directly?

Thanks for letting me know.

Kind regards.

David.
