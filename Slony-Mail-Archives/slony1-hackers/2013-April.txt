Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Interesting paper on triggers
Message-ID: <CANfbgbZ3zyz0scp9cnvGAkG99gid+krBLVsARSFhwa36c0Ubxg@mail.gmail.com>

Here's a somewhat retrospective paper on the applications of triggers
and constraints in database systems; nothing fundamentally new, but
it's interesting to see an overview of all sorts of ways triggers have
been used, and how things have progressed since the concept was first
proposed for SQL

Lingering Issues
