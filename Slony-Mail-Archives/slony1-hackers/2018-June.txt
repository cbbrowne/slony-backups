	Hi Steve,
	Have you had time to review these suggested doc additions?
	Any info on which release this patch will appear in?
	Thanks,

            It looks fine (I've changed some indentation)
            
            I am okay merging this https://github.com/ssinger/slony1-engine/tree/akamai 
            into master.
            
            However we do need to also update the admin guide to describe the new 
            options.

As I understand the issues, there is a choice to either maintain or assign away the Akamai copyright for the code I wrote.  Per our previous discussion, we?re maintaining the Akamai copyright. This is accomplished by header comments and/or some meta-data in the patch. If the header comment is a problem, then the patch meta-data becomes essential. If slony1-hackers can agree on exactly what copyright changes are needed, I can take them back to Akamai opensource.

That seemed like something I shouldn?t override with a customization. Re: snprintf, that seems like a good improvement. I see snprintf can also truncate output, so I?ll need to account for that as well with a rewrite.

Maybe something closer to the attached patch?

I am not happy with the description for PGHOME because it fails to account 
for the fact that this code doesn't get compiled in if PGPORT is available 
at compile time.  I don't see a good way of explaining this to users.

Maybe this switch shouldn't be based on a compile-time conditional?

Should this switch really be a command line argument instead of an 
environment variable such as

slonik --pg-share-dir=/usr/local/pg95/share

And if the argument is set we use that path ?
