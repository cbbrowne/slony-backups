Subject: [Slony1-hackers] pgport again
Message-ID: <50C25B6B.1060508@ca.afilias.info>

Just so people (packagers?) are aware

I've pushed a pair of commits to REL_2_1_STABLE and master that adds a 
configure option

--with-pgport=yes  (default no)

that has slonik link with pgport. A previous version of slony always 
linked with pgport but we removed this a while back. In this case the 
get_share_path and find_my_exec functions from pgport will be used to 
determine PGSHARE at runtime.  This is to make it easier for packgers 
that build Postgresql installs with a install location that is set at 
runtime (ie Windows).

If anyone has issues with this change now would be a good time to raise 
them.  Since we are defaulting to no (except on windows) I don't see 
this as a big deal.

Steve
