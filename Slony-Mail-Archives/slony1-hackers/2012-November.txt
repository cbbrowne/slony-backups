Uh? You changed a behavior based on something "probably"?

I missed any discussion on this as well as the commit itself, so I may
be missing some context... but assuming pids are sequential seems
problematic, particularly on Windows where they may not actually be
assigned sequentially. On *nix of course, the counter can wrap...

One of the downsides to the 'keep the git history' approach of merging 
commits is that some of the intermediate states+commit comments don't 
actually reflect what finally got accepted/committed.

Chris and myself actually picked up on that during the review.  get_pid 
now uses the pid files slon generates instead of 'probably guessing the 
correct pid'.

But the fact that your paying attention brought a smile to my face. 
Feel free to point out any other potential issues you see with these 
patches.

On AIX, which is a UNIX(tm), PIDs are not assigned at all
sequentially.  (At least, not on versions I've touched lately.)  And
in other cases, "typically the smallest PID" does indeed have an
unfortunate failure case.

I'll note that Steve Singer and I both noted this issue, and commented
on it (see https://github.com/lkmatsumura/slony1-engine/commit/f25c29f91d61ca0f48af70a6492af101d48e079a),
which led to a later patch
(https://github.com/lkmatsumura/slony1-engine/commit/95e67acb641c9620d68f2f01307bf3129a593d7c)
which uses the PID file generated by Slony.

I'm very pleased that y'all are noticing the issues; in fact, there's
nothing to see here, as the fixed-up result did get drawn in.

I suppose there is merit to debating whether we should:

a) Merge patches in directly, which will tend to lead to situations
like this where people can notice, and get concerned about, interim
states where the patch wasn't quite right yet, or

b) Cherry pick a merged form of the patch, thereby losing the shape of
those interim patches, but losing the entertainment of threads like
this one :-).

At any rate, thanks for keeping your eyes peeled!  'Tis a good thing to do!
