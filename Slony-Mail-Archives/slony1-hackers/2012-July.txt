I have attached a simple patch that does this to bug 273
http://bugs.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=273

So far my tests are passing.

Subject: [Slony1-hackers] sl_log_1 doesn't stop to grow
Message-ID: <1343303674.69615.YahooMailNeo@web29804.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi 


Yesterday on our production server, the / partition was fully populated.

- Slony 1.2.22 is running on /
- our databases files are locate at /var/database
- PostgreSQL binaries are located into /opt/PostgresPlus/8.3R2AS/ inside of / partition


df -h / /var/database/
Filesystem??????????? Size? Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/VG1-root?? 18G? 2.1G?? 16G? 12% /
/dev/sdf1???????????? 253G? 176G?? 78G? 70% /var/database

Quick workaround was to clean up /tmp (inside of /)

However a couple hours ago, while I was trying to build a new set replication hangs.

I discovered that sl_log_1 table doesn't stop to growing. (more than 30GB size).

I would like to know if there is any temporary files generated by Slony which may explains why this table doesn't stop to grow.

I don't know if the two issues are linked.

Thanks for any help.

That can have two possible reasons.

1) A long running transaction.

2) A replica that is far behind.

Both situations prevent the log switching from sl_log_2 to sl_log_1 to 
complete. The long running transaction may still write log rows to 
sl_log_2 and the far behind replica would still need rows that are in 
sl_log_2. In both cases Slony cannot truncate sl_log_2 at this moment 
and therefore cannot initiate another log switch.

Note that under 1.2.x this is a serious issue. 1.2.x misses an 
optimization in the log select query which causes the query planner to 
not generate a lower index scan key. As your replicas advance to the end 
of those 30 GB with their SYNC processing, they will scan the whole 
thing over and over.

Slony does not create any temporary files. Unless you are using archive 
shipping, the only thing that comes to mind is the stdout, eventually on 
an unreasonably high debug level, redirected into some file without any 
log rotate mechanism.

Probably not.

Hi Jan,

Thanks for sharing these information.

Do you think it is worth waiting that replication could catch up properly.

Yesterday while this issue was occuring


- I stopped replication on all nodes and
- I restarted the PostgreSQL server on the master
- I restaerted Slony processes on all nodes.

Then I guess that my issue is related to "A replica that is far behind."
Indeed Slony processes are redirected localy on the disk (/ partition) with log_level = 1. I don't used any log rotate mechanism


There is free disk space (50GB) if need on /var/database partition or do you 
advise me to stop replication and rebuidl replication for scratch??

This is the last solution I have but I wanted to know if it is worth waiting.

I don't have enough information to say if it is worth or not.

Why do you guess instead of properly analyzing the problem?

Can you please run the query "select * from _<clustername>.sl_status;" 
twice on the master, waiting 5 minutes in between the runs and post the 
result here?

If the redirected Slony output is eating your space on the root 
partition, then using something like the Apache's rotatelogs or syslog 
would be a good way to fix that.

No, I suggest to figure out what the actual problem is. Do you knock 
down the house and build a new one if you find you cannot open the front 
door? Or do you call the locksmith to fix it?

I would also suggest to plan upgrading to a newer version of Slony.

Jan,


I would like to say that I appreciate your reply, your help and? your diagnostic. It is very helpful.


I may understand your opinion and you're right to say that you don't have enough information (...). 


Upgrading Slony version is a solution. (1.2 is very old!) I agree


Thanks.
