Subject: [Slony1-hackers] pgindent run
Message-ID: <CANfbgbaZrNNpZvmpb5HhK5=++MPX2iiP1sfjSLcfo1u2qybPXA@mail.gmail.com>

At some point, we should run pgindent against the codebase to bring
things back 'within policy' as far as indentation is concerned.

FYI, I have done a "test run" against the present state of master:
  <https://github.com/cbbrowne/slony1-engine/commit/bd2780a48d82563f9dad63c746dc1fb7ae57926e>

I did it based on the latest typedefs in PG HEAD:

postgres at cbbrowne [12:03:41] [~/slony1-engine.github/src] [indent-master *]
-> % for i in */*.c; do
for> pgindent /var/lib/postgresql/postgresql/src/tools/pgindent/typedefs.list $i
for> done

slonik/parser.c
Error at 459:
Error at 505:
#if stack overflowUnmatched #endif
slony_logshipper/parser.c
Error at 387:
Error at 433:
#if stack overflowUnmatched #endif%

It induces quite a lot of "churn," which is not something we'd likely
want to do just now, as there are a number of branches where work is
ongoing, and it would decidedly make merging less convenient.

Perhaps we run it as one of the final steps of preparing 2.1?

Subject: [Slony1-hackers] Bug #218 - in progress
Message-ID: <CANfbgbYGgOhj_VjGjfq7KMa8VVrwLRDCxnwEb2DJNPyLEtNaJA@mail.gmail.com>

I have a would-be merge-in of the latest bug#218 changes under way;
hopefully will complete that Monday.

I ran thru the regression tests, and had a pretty mixed result, as follows:

-> % cat testResult.test.txt
1,17,test1
9,0,testdatestyles
7,20,testddl
18,0,testdeadlockddl
13,0,testinherit
9,0,testinherit
7,28,testmergeset
15,0,testmultipaths
18,0,testmultiplemoves
16,0,testomitcopy
22,0,testschemanames
18,0,testseqnames
20,0,testtabnames
16,0,testutf8

I suspect that the failures indicate something up with my changes, but
that'll take some more poking around that won't be taking place today
:-(.

testddl can fail due to EXECUTE SCRIPT race conditions. I remember you 
talking about an WIP patch to that issue for 2.2.  (this is putting the 
DDL in sl_log)

Ah, yes.  Bug #137.
http://bugs.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=137
https://github.com/cbbrowne/slony1-engine/tree/bug137

I haven't touched it in a while - seems proper to wait until we're
done with 2.1 release.

The one piece of the merge that has left me uncertain is that at one
point, MOVE SET was locking sl_event_lock, but some versions are
locking sl_config_lock instead.

I *think* it ought to just be sl_config_lock, right?

I checked in a change related to that last week.

MOVE_SET must lock sl_event_lock because the moveset_int stored function 
creates a ACCEPT_SET event.
