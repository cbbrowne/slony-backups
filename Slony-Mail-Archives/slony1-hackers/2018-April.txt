	Hello Steve and Slony-I,
	After much discussion, Akamai has decided to assign copyright for the changes discussed here to me. I'm now contributing the changes as myself. Please find the work for the previous changes consolidated and attached as one "options" patch. The other issues discussed were also addressed. Please take another look when time allows. What would be the next steps here?
	Thanks,

	Tom    (

    How do you feel about instead having an option to disable the slony version 
    check.
    
    My concern with saying all 2.2.x versions are compatible or even that 
    certain minor/patch versions are compatible is the cross version testing 
    load it puts on slony maintainers and how it might restrict things in the 
    future.
    
    If instead we just provide a option to disable the version check users can 
    use this option as they see fit.

    > ttignor ? I?ve gone a few rounds on this with our opensource group. As I understand the issues, there is a choice to either maintain or assign away the Akamai copyright for the code I wrote.  Per our previous discussion, we?re maintaining the Akamai copyright. This is accomplished by header comments and/or some meta-data in the patch. If the header comment is a problem, then the patch meta-data becomes essential. If slony1-hackers can agree on exactly what copyright changes are needed, I can take them back to Akamai opensource.

    > ttignor ? Reviewing the changes, the HAVE_PGPORT clause is marked with a comment ?We need to find a share directory like PostgreSQL.?. That seemed like something I shouldn?t override with a customization. Re: snprintf, that seems like a good improvement. I see snprintf can also truncate output, so I?ll need to account for that as well with a rewrite.
