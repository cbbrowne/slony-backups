                Hello slony1-hackers,
                Here at Akamai we have been using Slony-I to scale out read capacity for our Alert Management System (AMS). Along the way we?ve needed to make a number of customizations. I?m submitting those now to consider for inclusion in the Slony-I code base. Please find the patches attached and meta info below which would be appropriate to use with code commits. Please take a look when time allows and let me know if there are any questions or other changes to consider.
                Thanks in advance,

                Patch: compatibility_v2.2.patch
                Summary: Allows version 2.2.x slon daemons to operate in any Slony-I version 2.2.x DB schema. Copyright (C) 2017 - Akamai Technologies, Inc

                Patch: pg_home_share_path.patch
                Summary: Allows the slonik configuration utility to discover the postgresql installation share path via the PG_HOME environment variable. Copyright (C) 2017 - Akamai Technologies, Inc

                Patch: remote_listen_serial_option.patch
                Summary: Provides a configuration option to allow slon daemon remote listeners to operate with either ?repeatable read? or ?serializable? transaction isolation. Copyright (C) 2017 - Akamai Technologies, Inc

Thank you for your submissions.

I will try to look at the patches individually.

compatibility_v2.2.patch

My understanding of this patch is so that you slon for any 2.2.x version to 
be able to connect and replicate against a backend database with any other 
2.2.y version (where x and y can be, but are not required to be equal).

This is something that we've resisted doing in the past. I think the reason 
why we've resisted doing this in the past is that the we've never wanted 
prevent ourselves from making an incompatible change, such as changing the 
signature of an internal stored function between minor versions.  I think 
we've also not wanted to have to take on the burden of testing all the 
combinations.

I guess my question to the wider list (and Jan and Chris in particular) is 
how do we feel about such a 'policy' change.

My gut is that I'd prefer a solution where we can say that certain ranges of 
minor versions are compatible without having to say that any 2.2.x versions 
are compatible.

I would be surprised if there wasn't a change somewhere in the 2.1.x 
lifecycle that broke compatibility.

Without looking closely I'm not prepared to even say that failovers between 
2.2.1 and 2.2.6 would work(because failover logic did change in this range).

A few things on the specific patch

If I am reading the above code correctly

2.2.1 and 2.2.9 would be compatible

2.10.1 and 2.10.2 would not be compatible

Would we be better off calling slonyVersionMajor() , slonyVersionMinor() and 
comparing the major/minor numbers directly to each other?

So for the pg_home patch.

The original code is

#ifdef HAVE_PGPORT
         /*
          * We need to find a share directory like PostgreSQL.
          */
         if (find_my_exec(argv[0],myfull_path) < 0)
         {
                 strcpy(share_path, PGSHARE);
         }
         else
         {
                 get_share_path(myfull_path, share_path);
         }
#else
         strcpy(share_path, PGSHARE);

And you are replacing it with the following.




  #else
+       char *pgHome = getenv("PG_HOME");
+       if (pgHome) {
+         strncpy(share_path, pgHome, MAXPGPATH-1);
+         share_path[MAXPGPATH-1] = '\0';
+         strncat(share_path, "/share", MAXPGPATH-1-strlen(pgHome));
+       } else {
         strcpy(share_path, PGSHARE);
+       }


The above code only gets compiled in if PGPORT is not defined/present at 
build time.  Is that your intention,  or do you want PG_HOME to take 
precendence even if pgport is present?

snprintf(share_path,"%s/share",pgHome,MAXPGPATH-1);

Would the above code be clearer? (I haven't tested/tried to compile above)
but trying to do this in one line?

I am not exactly sure what you mean by meta-data. Can you explain?
We can provide credit in the commit comments and release notes.

Slony follows the same principal as the main postgresql source code.
This is sort of discussed at 
https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Developer_FAQ#Do_I_need_to_sign_a_copyright_assignment.3F

Slony contributors maintain the copyright to their contributions.  The 
credit at "Copyright (c) 2003-2009, PostgreSQL Global Development Group"
As I understand it, the 'PostgreSQL Global Development Group" does not exist 
as a legal entity.  By contributing your code to slony you share in the 
copyright with all the other contributors.  You become one of the rights 
holders (in effect part of PGDG).

I am not a lawyer or copyright expert. The above is just my attempt 
paraphrase things and should not be taken with any legal significance.

I wouldn't have a problem with changing the date in the copyright notice 
from 2003-2009 to 2003-2018. The issue is with listing each contributor 
in each file.

Steve

	Yes, by ?meta-data? in this case  I meant the commit comments. I provided those with my original patch message and can send them again if needed. So would it work to remove the Akamai header lines and maintain the ?meta data? I provided in the commit comments and release notes?
