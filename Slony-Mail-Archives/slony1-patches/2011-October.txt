	in Postgresql 9.1
Message-ID: <CAJPTwKAV4Y1Sm0Yf+q4WjEbcqj7X4XPC6LQY0LdLgfT4Hif0kw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

      I am new to PostgreSQL, currently i am using postgresql9.1 on single
server for my application.
         But because of heavy load on DB i am trying for Master and slave
server and want to imlement Replication and Loadbalancing in it.
         From website i came to know replication is possible with slony, I
wanted to know about Loadbalancing. Loadbalancing is possible with slony? If
yes how we implement it?
I am looking forward for your valuable guidance and your consideration.
waiting for your reply through mail.
Thank you

With warm regards,
Prashant khabiya
