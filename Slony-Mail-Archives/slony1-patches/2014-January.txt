Subject: [Slony1-patches] Request for publishing new patch
Message-ID: <CAO2ZFatawit_CXNewn1+fD4Vjy2gx0jzw8t9i2aYtxz_WMWO5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I did a little patch that allow Slony to work with PostgreSQL databases
that have been installed on a system with local (time zone) that's not
supported by PostgreSQL.

Best regards,

Thierry B.
