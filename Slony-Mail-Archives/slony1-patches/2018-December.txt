Subject: [Slony1-patches] update documentation and --help to match defaults
Message-ID: <CACQaisv+SRG_UqbLg=wDVF=9z79gN_4jCwUy-YTC7sHwEd_hxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

It was brought to my attention that the default values listed in 1) the
documentation, 2) slon --help output, and 3) sample configs are not
consistent.  I put together a patch to update all the listed defaults to
match the defaults defined in src/slon/confoptions.c

Could you please review and comment?

Thanks,
--Richard
