We observe that the listen networks are commonly overly populated, particularly
in view that people configuring their Slony clusters often set up (not
wrongly!) full cross-product paths from all nodes to all nodes.

The trouble with this is that the resulting listen networks wind up setting up
event listening from too many node sources, and hence the slons servicing these
nodes are opening connections to multiple other nodes in the cluster, and we
therefore have more database connections being opened than we properly ought to
need.

Instead, we propose changing the listen networks as follows:

- If a node, A, is a subscriber to a set provided from node B, then node A need
*only* listen for events through node B.  We expect most nodes in a cluster to
be subscribers, and hence this rule typically allows them to have just one
listener entry, and one connection listening for events.

The more complex case, here is if A subscribes to sets from nodes B and C.  In
that case, we ought to be able to choose arbitrarily between B and C as a
source for all events coming to node A.

- If a node, B, does not subscribe to any sets, then we may expect one of two
things to be the case:

 a) Node B is quite likely to be the origin node for subscriptions.

 b) Alternatively, perhaps Node B is not yet a subscriber to any replication
set.

 In either case, we set up node B to listen for events from all nodes with
which it can communicate.  There may be quite a few listener entries in that
case, for node B, but, as the slon for this node isn't doing terribly much
other work (as, since this is not a subscribed node, there is no regular work
for a remote_worker thread), we mayn't care very much at there being somewhat
more connections being opened.

Unfortunately, this combination of rules does not ensure that all nodes are
being listened to; there may exist a set of nodes (A, B, C) where:

1.  B subscribes to sets on a node D, not in the set (A, B, C)

2.  Nodes A and C are non-subscribing nodes (whether origin or
non-participating does not matter)

3.  There is no path in sl_path from A to C

Hence, based on the rules above, nothing is yet listening for events from node
C, and node A is unable to do so directly

4.  Assume there is a path in sl_path from B to C

THEN...

In order for the listen network to work, we need to add two extra paths:

i) B must listen for events from node C directly, in spite of our expectation
that, as a subscriber, it could get all of its events from its subscription
provider.

ii) A must listen for events from node C via node B.

There may be more recursion involved with this than I have thus far pointed out
:-(.

--- Comment #1 from Christopher Browne <cbbrowne at ca.afilias.info> 2012-10-23 12:03:28 PDT ---
Steve Singer suggests that perhaps we're "trying too hard" here.

Ensuring that, with *possibly* partial sets of paths, all nodes are getting all
events, may be pretty troublesome when considering the non-subscribing nodes.

The alternative is to consider that:

a) If the administrator set up a STORE PATH entry to indicate that node #1 can
pull data from node #3, then it is not unreasonable for the slon to use that
connection, as clearly intended.

b) If an administrator wishes to diminish the number of database connections,
they may readily do so by removing them (either by omitting STORE PATH, or by
submitting DROP PATH).  They may expect to benefit from there being fewer
database connections being opened.

c) There are times when additional paths will need to be added, such as at the
time of FAIL OVER.  Administrators are free to do so; it is expected to work
perfectly well, as long as the nodes are up.

We might improve our documentation to explain this.  Probably this would best
fit with the discussion of Listen Paths:
