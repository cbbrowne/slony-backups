This fix looks safe to commit.
I haven't verified if the fix actually fixes the problem reported.

How difficult is it to write a unit test that would reproduce this issue?

Yes, we use "exceptions" in pl/pgslq. I'll try to check, if this could be the
source of problem.

We also use prepared transactions managed by application server. Maybe
two-phase commits affects slony operation?
