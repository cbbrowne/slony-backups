Subject: [Slony1-bugs] [Bug 355] New: execute script () modifies search_path
Message-ID: <bug-355-4@http.www.slony.info/bugzilla/>

http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=355

           Summary: execute script () modifies search_path
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: devel
          Platform: All
        OS/Version: All
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: low
         Component: slonik
        AssignedTo: slony1-bugs at lists.slony.info
        ReportedBy: prybak at afilias.info

   Estimated Hours: 0.0


If there is a
set search_path to ...
statement in script provided to execute script function, the setting remains
after slonik finishes.

It manifests itself as a problem when there is a replicated table with a
trigger set to enable always on it.
On a replica such a trigger will execute function with search_path set by the
last dll ran by slonik's execute script function.
