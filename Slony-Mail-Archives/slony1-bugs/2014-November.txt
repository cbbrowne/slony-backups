Subject: [Slony1-bugs] [Bug 355] New: execute script () modifies search_path
Message-ID: <bug-355-4@http.www.slony.info/bugzilla/>

http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=355

           Summary: execute script () modifies search_path
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: devel
          Platform: All
        OS/Version: All
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: low
         Component: slonik
        AssignedTo: slony1-bugs at lists.slony.info
        ReportedBy: prybak at afilias.info
                CC: slony1-bugs at lists.slony.info
   Estimated Hours: 0.0


If there is a
set search_path to ...
statement in script provided to execute script function, the setting remains
after slonik finishes.

It manifests itself as a problem when there is a replicated table with a
trigger set to enable always on it.
On a replica such a trigger will execute function with search_path set by the
last dll ran by slonik's execute script function.

--- Comment #1 from Christopher Browne <cbbrowne at ca.afilias.info> 2014-11-12 13:27:19 PST ---
The stored function should be protecting itself; if it depends on having a
particular search path, it should do so as part of the stored function
definition.

So it seems to me that there's a bug in the stored function.  (And I suspect I
myself might very well get assigned to fix that bug...)

Slony itself operates relatively safely as it specifies fully qualified object
names in most (hard to prove "all") cases.

It seems like it would be a good idea for the code that runs at the end of DDL
processing (see src/backend/slony1_funcs.c) to add in "RESET ALL;" to reset the
environment at the end of DDL processing in case search paths or other GUCs got
messed with by DDL.

There's a further bit of risk; if a DDL script is messing around with GUCs,
that risks messing with another DDL script that might be run in the same SYNC. 
It seems a good idea to add a warning to users that messing around with GUCs in
DDL could injure other users...
