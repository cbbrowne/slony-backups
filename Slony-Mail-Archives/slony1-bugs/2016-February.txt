Subject: [Slony1-bugs] Slon Daemon - no timestamps
Message-ID: <2AD0E316-833F-412A-B4BD-01C44A198471@rackspace.com>

I have Slony 2.2.4 installed on Centos 6.7 x86_64 from the PGDG 9.3 repo.

No matter what settings I set in the slony.conf file, I cannot get the Slon daemon to include timestamps in the slon log output.

I've tried changing both "log_timestamp" and "log_timestamp_format" settings in various combinations ("true","yes","1", etc.; even "no" in the hopes it was mistakenly coded backwards) without any success.

I know that the Slon daemon is using this config file because I have the DB connection set in it and if I change it then it fails to connect.

The lack of timestamps makes it incredibly difficult to diagnose problems after they occur.

I have tried enabling syslog logging, but the syslog logging doesn't include all the output that goes to the slon log.

Any suggestions to get timestamps working would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Rob

Subject: [Slony1-bugs] Slonik output
Message-ID: <67CA1A4A-161A-4582-AF67-49D7B10F11EA@rackspace.com>

I'm using slonik v2.2.4 installed from the PG v9.3 PGDG repository running on Centos 6.7 x86_64.

Can someone modify the slonik utility to output some useful information?  And timestamps too?

It would be nice if slonik had a "-e" command-line option to have it echo everything to stdout instead of having no output by default.  We modify all our scripts to intersperse "ECHO" commands in the input, but this is a total waste of valuable time.

And Slonik definitely needs to have an option to echo the SQL executed via "EXECUTE SCRIPT" commands to stdout as well.  Slonik v1.2 used to do this by default.

Thanks
Rob

What output do you get if you start slon without a config file.

When I start slon  I get

slon  test 'host=localhost port=5432 dbname=test2'
2016-02-29 09:24:42 EST CONFIG main: slon version 2.3.0 starting up
2016-02-29 09:24:42 EST INFO   slon: watchdog process started
2016-02-29 09:24:42 EST CONFIG slon: watchdog ready - pid = 25047
2016-02-29 09:24:42 EST CONFIG slon: worker process created - pid = 25048
2016-02-29 09:24:42 EST CONFIG main: Integer option vac_frequency = 3
2016-02-29 09:24:42 EST CONFIG main: Integer option log_level = 0
2016-02-29 09:24:42 EST CONFIG main: Integer option sync_interval = 2000
2016-02-29 09:24:42 EST CONFIG main: Integer option 
sync_interval_timeout = 10000


the timestamps are printed.


What if you leave all of
log_timestamp, log_timestamp_format out of the config file.

Thanks Steve.  Yes, without a config file I get timestamps.

And I spent some time today trying to figure out which parameter is causing this behavior.  It seems to only be happening if "SYSLOG" is set to anything other than zero.

We prefer a SYSLOG setting of 1 because we have a central syslog logging and reporting facility where the messages are sent.  But the DEBUG level messages are important to us too, and they only get sent to the slony log file, but they don't have timestamps (making them far less useful).


Which brings up another problem, why don't DEBUG messages get sent to syslog too?  If they were in syslog then we could set SYSLOG=3 and be done with it.

So, IMHO, two bugs:

1) No timestamp in the slon daemon logs when SYSLOG=1
2) Slon daemon DEBUG messages never get sent to SYSLOG with any setting.


Thanks,
Rob

Looking at the logging code in misc.c

Yes it will only log timestamps if syslog is disabled, I would guess 
that the thinking was that syslog itself would record the timestamp? Ie 
if you want the timestamp in your log you have syslog record it.

When I log to syslog, I get the following in /var/log/message

Feb 29 16:15:08 ssinger-laptop slon[10930]: [1-1] CONFIG main: slon 
version 2.3.0 starting up

If the message also included the timestamp then the timestamp would show 
up twice in /var/log/message


Also I am getting debug messages in my syslog debug log

tail -f /var/log/debug

Feb 29 21:44:49 ssinger-laptop slon[15449]: [43-1] DEBUG2 stack_init() -

My slon conf is

log_level=4
syslog=1


Maybe you should check your syslog configuration?
