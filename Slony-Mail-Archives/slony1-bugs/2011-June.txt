These patches do not work with 9.0

tgargs in pg_trigger is now stored in a different format.

Does anyone know how to decode this? 
In a way that works in all versions of PG?

Created an attachment (id=102)
 --> (http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=102)
updates to the patch for 9.0 support

This update to the patch adds a C function that will decode tgargs in 9.0.

It will also print a warning on tables that need repair but are skipped because
no lock was previously obtained on the table.

A run of the regression tests encountered this issue 43 types.  When I run
those tests against REL_2_0_STABLE (2.0.7rc1) I don't get any of those errors.

In one instance of testing a slon kept aborting, retrying and failing on
serialize access errors for many minutes before being lucky enough to make
progress.

Under postgresql 9.1 beta x (master sometime after beta 1)

I see the following in my postgresql log

slonik seems to be defaulting to 8.3 behaviour when it can't recognize the

This is a proposed fix for bug 219.

The problem only applies to 2.1, REL_2_0_STABLE already seems to have the
correct behaviour.

--- Comment #2 from Steve Singer <ssinger at ca.afilias.info> 2011-06-08 08:54:41 PDT ---

The answer to my previous question is in the PostgreSQL documentation for 'lock
table'
----------
To achieve a similar effect when running a transaction at the Serializable
isolation level, you have to execute the LOCK TABLE statement before executing
any SELECT or data modification statement. A serializable transaction's view of
data will be frozen when its first SELECT or data modification statement
begins. A LOCK TABLE later in the transaction will still prevent concurrent
writes ? but it won't ensure that what the transaction reads corresponds to the
latest committed values. 
-----------------

We should move the lock table on sl_config_lock to be outside of the
storePath_int call, similar to what we did for sl_event_lock.

Looks like a good change to me.

I kicked off regression tests against an instance with this patch; tests are
running fine thus far.

If there's a particular test that tends to expose failures, it would be a fine
thing to point out which one it is...

Bug report from Glyn Still
--
Hi Guys,

Just had an issue with subscribe set in 2.0.6.  From what I can see somehow
slonik is passing parameters 
to reshapesubscription in the wrong order, instead of (sub_set, sub_provider,
sub_receiver) it seems to be 
sending (sub_provider, sub_set, sub_receiver).  In turn that made slonik hang
on me and borked my subscriptions. 

Here's what I submitted to slonik:

    SUBSCRIBE SET ( ID = 1000, PROVIDER = 4, RECEIVER = 5, FORWARD = YES );

Here's the error message I get from slonik:

    Way5b:/pgsql/slony# slonik reshape.scr
    reshape.scr:17: ATTEMPT:  SUBSCRIBE SET
    reshape.scr:18: NOTICE:  subscribe set: omit_copy=f

    CONTEXT:  SQL statement "SELECT  "_main_replication".subscribeSet_int( $1 ,

    PL/pgSQL function "reshapesubscription" line 11 at SQL statement
    error reshaping subscriber

And here's what my reshapesubscription looks like:

    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION _main_replication.reshapesubscription(integer,
integer, integer)
      RETURNS integer AS
    $BODY$
    declare
        p_sub_set            alias for $1;
        p_sub_provider        alias for $2;
        p_sub_receiver        alias for $3;
    begin
        -- ----
        -- Grab the central configuration lock
        -- ----
        lock table "_main_replication".sl_config_lock;

        update "_main_replication".sl_subscribe set sub_provider=p_sub_provider
               WHERE sub_set=p_sub_set AND sub_receiver=p_sub_receiver;
        if found then
           perform "_main_replication".RebuildListenEntries();
           notify "_main_replication_Restart";
        end if;
        return 0;
    end
    $BODY$
    LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE;

Looking in the slonik.c starting on on line 3541 I can see the following:

                slon_mkquery(&query,
                                         "select
\"_%s\".reshapeSubscription(%d,%d,%d);",
                                         stmt->hdr.script->clustername,
                                         stmt->sub_provider,stmt->sub_setid,
                                         stmt->sub_receiver);

Unless I'm going crazy (It is now 4am), that pretty much looks the wrong way
around to me?

Thanks
Glyn

It scares me that decoding trigger arguments required an SPI function.

Actually, poking at pg_trigger suggests that the problem isn't at the Slony
level...  I wonder who came up with the notion that the following was
reasonable...

slonyregress1 at localhost->  select tgnargs, tgargs from pg_trigger where tgnargs
> 0;
 tgnargs |                           tgargs

I'd be inclined to feed some griping about this representation up to
pgsql-hackers, in the hopes of getting something nicer, maybe?

Not that that's too likely for 9.1 :-)

Does this actually solve the problem or does it only lower the chance of
running into it?

You remember we had the discussion about LOCK TABLE with respect to snapshots
and realized, that LOCK TABLE statements at the beginning of a transaction
actually cause the lock to be taken out BEFORE the transaction snapshot is
generated. However, this LOCK TABLE cannot be done from inside of a stored
procedure because SELECTing that SP causes the snapshot to be generated before
the LOCK TABLE statement itself.

My gut feeling is that we need slonik to do the LOCK on the sl_config_log at
the beginning of any transaction, where it intends to call SPs that change the
configuration.

Maybe we aren't supposed to query pg_trigger, but query the
information_schema.triggers view instead?

I am inclined to agree with you.  I don't think we should be taking locks in
the stored procedures, so slonik + a few parts of slon might need to do this.

I see no reason to fix this in 2.0.

In 2.1 we removed the 'lock sl_config_lock' at the top of the slon remote
worker thread, we  did this because it could cause deadlocks with the
sl_event_lock that slonik now obtains.   An argument can be made that since we
are messing with locking behaviour in 2.1 anyway, and some of our chances
exposed some of the behaviour issues under testing then we should properly fix
the problem in 2.1 

Thoughts?

The information schema gives rows like


 EXECUTE PROCEDURE _slonyregress.logtrigger('_slonyregress', '1', 'k')


we could

a) build up a similar line in the query in the plpgsql function and do a text
comparision
b) Do regex matching to extract the 'k' from the arguments
c) use the C function like the patch proposes.

I dislike (b).  I'm not opposed to (a), but comparing just the trigger
arguments seems more direct to me, even if it involves a C function to get them

I agree. But that causes us to go back to development and out of BETA.

I would favor a). Although it will lead to a rather cryptic and non-intuitive
behavior should the information_schema.triggers view ever change the
representation (it didn't since 8.3 and I didn't bother checking earlier
versions). What it would tell is that all the unlocked tables have changed but
it won't do anything about it. Then again any regexp implementation could
behave just the same, so there is not much to gain from that.

patch to use time from epoch

This patch should avoid the issue since slon will now send postgres the time
in seconds from epoch.

I suggest that if we guard ourselves by having a decent regression test, so
that if the view changes, we're quite likely to notice, then yes, a) seems
better to me.

I don't think this destroys "beta"; it should be a moderate amount of work to
shift the locks on sl_config_lock into the first query run.

I'll take a look at this.

Attempting to LOCK and already locked table only wastes some CPU cycles, so
doing it in a rather generic fashion would be OK, IMHO.

Created an attachment (id=108)
 --> (http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=108)
replace C function to decode trigger arguments with string matching

This patch to be appplied ontop of the others will remove the C function that
decodes the trigger arguments and replaces it with string matching code against
information_schema.triggers.

I feel that the C function is cleaner and more future proof.  To get this patch
to work I had to be careful about matching spaces and quotes in the function
with the format the information schema returns.  I have not yet done a lot of
testing and suspect that this version of the patch might break with mixed case
slony clusternames (if so that should be fixable).

The C function works and should continue to work with future postgres versions
because it uses the same infrastructure to decode tgargs as postgersql uses
when it invokes the trigger.  With the string matching approach we are
depending on a unit test to tell us that something suttle has changed in
postgresql after the fact.

I have opened up my own "bug218" branch, and added the following patch:

https://github.com/cbbrowne/slony1-engine/commit/9bd169a5f872ddef48d73168e66970c53b39110d

It adds requests for locks on sl_config_lock to remote_worker.c and slonik.c.

The interesting part is that, in many cases, the initial statement locks both
sl_config_lock *and* sl_event_lock, which seems likely to be quite an
improvement in safety.

I'm running regression tests against this right now; if there's some other test
load that is better to try, let me know.

Also remember to remove the 'LOCK @NAMESPACE at .sl_config_lock' lines from
slony_funcs.sql - since a) the locking is now being done elsewhere, no point in
paying a penalty twice.  b) Leaving it in there is a bit confusing since
someone else might come along and think that it is okay to obtain
sl_config_lock in the stored functions

Good point, though the price isn't too terribly high.

Have done so, and had a successful run of all the regression tests against
this.

Consider it to be an open question, for now, whether or not something more
extensive should be done about this.

It would be an interesting idea to have Slony components loaded as extensions,
as this might be an easier way for users to deploy it.

Details as to how this sort of thing would work will probably emerge after the
release of PG 9.1, so it doesn't make sense to do anything more with this for
the time being.

                    and cleanup
           Product: Slony-I

I report a problem on slony-I 2.0.6 (or HEAD).

We define a implicit cast on INT to TEXT for the migration 
PostgreSQL 8.2.x to 9.0.x. This causes Slony-I errors at
initialize and cleanup-thread.

It seems to me that to add explicit cast in addPartialLogIndices()
is the workaround.


cast definition:

CREATE CAST ( int4 AS text ) WITH INOUT AS IMPLICIT;

It turns out that the fixes to make strings match with mixed case breaks all
lower case schema names.

This is another example of why I think the string matching approach is a bad
idea.
If you disagree with me then take a look at this then spend some time trying to
fix the patch so it works in both with the various versions of Pg.

Otherwise I think we should go back to the C function for decoding these
trigger arguments.

Thanks. It works well.

I have not done tests it about all slonik-commands.
At least, it's OK about initialize and usual run.

Subject: [Slony1-bugs] [Bug 222] New: cleanup thread can lock out new
 application connections
Message-ID: <bug-222-4@http.www.slony.info/bugzilla/>

http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=222

           Summary: cleanup thread can lock out new application
                    connections
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: 2.0
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: low
         Component: trigger SPI
        AssignedTo: slony1-bugs at lists.slony.info
        ReportedBy: ssinger at ca.afilias.info
                CC: slony1-bugs at lists.slony.info
   Estimated Hours: 0.0


We've had a report of the following scenario

1.  A remote slon executes the log fetch query.  This transaction will obtain
AccessShare locks on sl_log_1 and sl_log_2.    This transaction runs for a
while (in the example we were sent this took an unusually long time due to
network/WAN issues)

2. The cleanupThread ones and determines  logswitch_finish() is ready to
truncate a log table, ie sl_log_1.   The cleanup thread transaction blocks at
the 'trucnate sl_log_1' command.  It is blocking waiting for the AccessShare
lock to go away.

3. A new connection to the database is started, this connection tries to insert
into a replicated table.  The first time the log trigger runs it prepares
prepared statements for inserting into both sl_log_1 and sl_log_2.  Preparing
these requires a row exclusive lock on the table but this is stuck waiting for
the cleanupThread to obtain (and then finish with) its lock.  

This is only an issue if the connection in step (3) is a new connection, the
actual row into sl_log_x will not be inserted into the table being truncated
but because we prepare the statements ahead of time on both tables the system
is at risk.

The solution is to modify the log trigger to prepare the statements for
sl_log_1 and sl_log_2 the first time THAT statement is needed.

Step #2 shouldn't be able to be.

If you look at logswitch_finish(), it doesn't request a "bare" truncate of
sl_log_1 or sl_log_2.  When looking at using TRUNCATE (to replace the former
DELETE requests), I was specifically concerned about this sort of case.

It doesn't "bare truncate" - instead, it first attempts to grab an exclusive
lock, with the NOWAIT option.

If there's a competing lock on sl_log_1/sl_log_2, then the attempt to lock will
fail, and you'll get an exception raised such as:

    Slony-I: could not lock sl_log_2 - sl_log_2 not truncated

It only submits a TRUNCATE request if that lock request succeeds, with the
consequence that there's no reason for the transaction to block at the point of
the TRUNCATE request.  At *that* point, it already has an exclusive lock on the
table.

Are you sure this is an issue in 2.0?  It might have been plausible in 1.2.

Yes this was with 2.0.6 on a 8.3.x system.

Try the following

T1:
begin;
select * FROM _test.sl_log_1;
select * FROM _test.sl_log_2;


Next open a second connection
begin;
lock table _test.sl_log_2 in exclusive mode no wait;
truncate table _test.sl_log_2; 


The 'nowait' passes but the truncate doesn't.

Subject: [Slony1-bugs] [Bug 223] New: slonik can wait for a node it just
	uninstalled
Message-ID: <bug-223-4@http.www.slony.info/bugzilla/>

http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=223

           Summary: slonik can wait for a node it just uninstalled
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: devel
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: low

Create a slonik cluster with a few nodes (say 1,2,3).

The perform an uninstall node on 1 and 2.

Start slonik back up and init cluster(id=1);  and store node(id=2);

Start slonik up again.

uninstall node(id=3);
subscribe set(id=1, provider=1,receiver=3);

slonik will print stuff like:
'waiting for events  (3,5000000077) only at (3,0) to be confirmed on node 1'

When slonik sees an uninstall node it needs to erase the remembered 'last
event' from that node.

This was observed with 2.1.0 beta 2
