Subject: [Slony1-bugs] Postgres 9.3 + Slony-I 2.2.0 + PgAdmin 1.18.0 on
 Windows Server 2003 R2 Enterprise 32 Bit
Message-ID: <CAL349-y+8kPiHTjOUxVQaGNEbP0+4BzMsRN0pkU4Gy+vaVV2jA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello there,

I can not get Slony-I running on the setup mentioned in the subject. I
always get the message that the Slony-I scripts are not available. I tried
everything, to no avail.

Slony-I path in PgAdmin is pointing to the postgres' share folder, which
contains several slony scripts. I'm running out of options and I really
need to get replication up and running.

Can someone help me out here?

regards,
Sven

Ok, thanks for the answer. Could you point me in the direction of a good
starters guide for Slony-I on a windows server system? I haven't been able
to find anything useful...

Sven
