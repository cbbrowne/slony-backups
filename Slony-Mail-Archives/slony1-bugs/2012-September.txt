I can pass CFLAGS to configure, like

./configure CFLAGS='-O2 -g'

and they will be used.  But if I do the same thing with CPPFLAGS or LDFLAGS,
they will be ignored.

This is a problem in the context of applying "hardening" options to the Debian
package.

Message-ID: <bug-279-4@http.www.slony.info/bugzilla/>

           Summary: something wrong with store listen on 2.1
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: devel
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux

For the Debian packages, I have a simple test script, which you can see here:

http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-postgresql/tags/slony1-2/2.0.7-4/debian/slony1-test.sh?view=markup

It creates a master and a slave instance, replicates a few rows, and see if
they arrive.  This script has worked essentially unchanged since the 1.2 days.

Now I upgraded the package from 2.0.7 to 2.1.2, and when I run the test script,
the call

store listen ( origin = 1, provider = 1, receiver = 2 );

(line 82 in the above link) hangs and keeps writing messages like this
indefinitely:

<stdin>:14: waiting for event (1,5000000007) to be confirmed on node 2

I have removed the store listen calls, since they are obsolete, but it's still
suspicious that this doesn't work anymore, especially since there are changes
in slony 2.1 regarding implicit waiting.  So maybe this should be investigated.
