I am closing this bug since we were provided no additional information on it.
I am assuming that the version of pgadmin isn't compatible with the version of
slony.

Pretty old issue, but since I am actually working on this and Steve pointed me
towards this entry, why not comment on it.

What I have in mind of implementing is

EXECUTE SCRIPT (SQL='<string>', ...);

Any language that is even remotely useful for doing anything with a database
can properly escape an SQL literal value (string in single quotes). The Slonik
parser can deal with them on the flex level. So this should be very easy to
implement as well as use.

Do we really need the dollar quoting?

Here is a version of the fix that still checks sl_local_node_id but does it
without calling any C functions.

How are you running configure?

./configure --with-pgconfigdir=/usr/local/my_pg_install_bin_dir

or some other way?

where is pg_config on your system

           Summary: Make the symbols in the shared library unique
           Product: Slony-I
           Version: devel
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: low

   Estimated Hours: 0.0


This comes from discussions at PGCON

A backend can now have multiple versions of the slony shared library loaded.
This can lead to confusion and conflicts in symbol names.  To prevent this we
need the symbols to contains the version name (or have some other way of
specifying uniqueness)

Yes, we do use that switch and it works all fine with PG9.2. But, not
with PG9.3.

./configure --with-pgconfigdir=$PG_PGHOME/bin --with-pgport=yes

I also confirmed that $PG_PGHOME contains the installation.

I can reproduce this when I build with --with-pgport=yes

The error in config.log is

configure:5709: gcc -o conftest -g -O2  -I/usr/local/pgsql93git/include/ 
-I/usr/local/pgsql93git/include/server/  -L/usr/local/pgsql93git/lib/ 
conftest.c  -lpgport >&5
/usr/local/pgsql93git/lib//libpgport.a(wait_error.o): In function 
`wait_result_to_str':
wait_error.c:(.text+0xa1): undefined reference to `pstrdup'

9.3 introduces a new library libpgcommon if we link in with both pgport 
and libpgcommon this error seems to go away.

The attached patch will link in libpgcommon , when using pgport if 
pgcommon exists.

--- Comment #3 from Steve Singer <ssinger at ca.afilias.info> 2013-05-28 09:57:43 PDT ---
I took a look at the code here.
https://github.com/wieck/slony1-engine/commits/execute-script-fixes

The slonik command:


execute script(SQL='insert into foo values (''foo'');', execute only on=1,
event node=1);

gives

PGRES_FATAL_ERROR [insert into foo values (foo);] - ERROR:  column "foo" does
not exist
LINE 1: insert into foo values (foo);

We seem to be eating the two single quotes.

Also

I get an error if I specify EXECUTE ONLY ON , but leave out 'event node'. 
According to the docs (and in slony 2.1) this worked.  (this isn't directly
related to this change.

Fixed that. The scanner swallowed 2 single quotes silently.
