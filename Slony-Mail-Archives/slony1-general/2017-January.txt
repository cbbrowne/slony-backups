Not sure how we can help to fix it though.

Oh dear.  I closed several hundred of them yesterday, with the faint
hope that it was a one-off situation; apparently something is running
on an ongoing basis, generating bugs consisting of "material of spammy
consistency" on the Slony Bugzilla instance.

Joshua Drake has been enquring as to whether or not we should see
about updating some things (he's been thinking of the OS and
PostgreSQL) on slony.info; I suspect we need to do something regarding
the version of Bugzilla, with the dose of wishful thinking that
perhaps a later version would be more resistant to this spamulous
activity.

I suggest weighing in on Joshua's comments; we should muse a bit on
what to do about all this.

I am right now seeing up to 6 bugs opened per minute. I suggest we shut
bugzilla down until we can figure this out.

or switch the new accounts creation to be moderated and delete all the 
spammy accounts

Someone with bugzilla admin access will need to do this (or do something 
else to stop the spam)
(not having bugzilla admin access I can't do this)

I setup this instance about 8-9 years ago, set myself as default CC, and now I
received every ticket twice over the last few days -- then I remembered that I
am also an admin.

Anyway, I shutdown the instance, by enabling shutdownhtml parameter. Noone can
create now bugs from now on.

Please let me know if I can help more.

You can actually get at the bug data...

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbbrowne/slony-backups/master/Slony-Bugzilla/individual-bugs/111.html

I don't think the problem is too likely to be what's in bug #111, though.

We made a change several versions back to no longer default to Node #1
as the event node.

I'd expect to see "node -1" being reported on if you have an old
Slonik script from the "default is 1" days.  These days, you need to
add an "event node=[some value which *could* be 1]" clause to some of
the Slonik statements.

When confronted by a difficult problem, solve it by reducing it to the
question, "How would the Lone Ranger handle this?"

This is a rather old version of slony so I'm sure the bug still exists in
this version.
I'm tempted to do some event surgery fully aware that the patient may not
survive.

That being said can events just be removed ?
