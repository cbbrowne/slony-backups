Subject: [Slony1-general] A BRIN experiment with Slony
Message-ID: <CANfbgbaB55Ww21i08-Wdu3ev5dfdd8JhOkNZkYwQSqbQjnOaSw@mail.gmail.com>

I have set up a branch where I attempt adding in some BRIN indexes (new in
9.5), in the interests of seeing if this (supposedly cheaper) index
provides some improvement in performance.

https://github.com/cbbrowne/slony1-engine/tree/brinexperiment

In running it against a Slony instance on Postgres 9.5, I do find that
*some* queries certainly make use of the BRIN indexes.  It's too early to
conclude it makes things better/stronger/faster, but I would be hopeful.
