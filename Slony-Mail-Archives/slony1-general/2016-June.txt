Subject: [Slony1-general] A BRIN experiment with Slony
Message-ID: <CANfbgbaB55Ww21i08-Wdu3ev5dfdd8JhOkNZkYwQSqbQjnOaSw@mail.gmail.com>

I have set up a branch where I attempt adding in some BRIN indexes (new in
9.5), in the interests of seeing if this (supposedly cheaper) index
provides some improvement in performance.

https://github.com/cbbrowne/slony1-engine/tree/brinexperiment

In running it against a Slony instance on Postgres 9.5, I do find that
*some* queries certainly make use of the BRIN indexes.  It's too early to
conclude it makes things better/stronger/faster, but I would be hopeful.

Message-ID: <CADyzmyzgHzyTjsHkSM2k5EJQAkCHR_2tcNwybwXJ2N1tg8tr7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,

We run slony 2.2.3 on a postgres 9.2 platform. I am attempting to drop a
table from the slony registration:

 select * from _replication.sl_table where tab_relname = 'content_viewers';
 tab_id | tab_reloid |   tab_relname   | tab_nspname | tab_set |
tab_idxname      | tab_altered |                  tab_comment

--------+------------+-----------------+-------------+---------+----------------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------
    140 |    1999743 | content_viewers | public      |       6 |
content_viewers_pkey | f           | Table public.content_viewers with
primary key

When I attempt a slonik_drop_table:


./slonik_drop_table -c
/postgres_data/prime/PSQL_92/slon_tools.primeprod.conf  140 6 |
./bin/slonik &


I get this error:


[pguser at ardbc01 bin]$ <stdin>:6: PGRES_FATAL_ERROR lock table
"_replication".sl_event_lock, "_replication".sl_config_lock;select

Please advise.  thanks!

Yes it does - only one replica being used.
Question - do the index names on the master and replica have to match?

The indexes are not touched by the replication system. You could drop them
directly to see if somehow that was a problem.

In answer to my own question - yes the primary key index on the table
itself
has to match with the entry in sl_table because the function
alterTableDropTriggers()
runs a join requiring a match for tables, indices and schema names.  I had
changed the
pk name a couple months back which did not change the name in sl_table,
hence the
'NOT FOUND'

Hello,

I thought I was out of the woods but apparently not.  I changed the index
name and the slonik_drop_table apparently worked
However I am still getting the following error in the slony log and it has
suspended replication:

  "lock table "_replication".sl_config_lock;select
"_replication".setDropTable_int(140);insert into "_replication".sl_event
  (ev_origin, ev_seqno, ev_timestamp,      ev_snapshot, ev_type , ev_data1
   ) values ('1', '5021650374', '2016-06-23 12:25:10.772052-04',
'3309223886:3309223886:', 'SET_DROP_TABLE', '140'); insert into
"_replication".sl_confirm    (con_origin, con_received, con_seqno,
con_timestamp)    values (1, 3, '5021650374', now()); commit transaction;"
PGRES_FATAL_ERROR ERROR:  Slony-I: alterTableDropTriggers(): Table with id
140 not found

CONTEXT:  SQL statement "SELECT
"_replication".alterTableDropTriggers(p_tab_id)"
PL/pgSQL function _replication.setdroptable_int(integer) line 52 at PERFORM
2016-06-23 16:27:02 EDT CONFIG slon: child terminated signal: 9; pid:
78119, current worker pid: 78119
2016-06-23 16:27:02 EDT CONFIG slon: restart of worker in 10 seconds

At this point all I want to do is for this process to stop. It apparently
is trying to correct my previous screw-up and I already 'corrected' it.

Any ideas, comments welcome. Thank you

No, they don't have to.
One of the strength of this kind of replication solution is the ability you
have to create different indexes on each nodes.

Is the table referenced on both nodes in sl_tables table?

Subject: [Slony1-general] cannot safely MOVE SET, DROP NODE
Message-ID: <29233BBA-3D6C-45B5-917D-BAF11AF9955F@akamai.com>


                Hello slony community,
                I?m working now on some slony1 failover automation (slony1-2.2.4) and I?m having a lot of trouble getting slony1 to honor MOVE SET commands. Below are the commands I?m using, to my mind pretty simple instructions to move a set and confirm everyone gets the message (wait for event, confirmed by all) before moving on. Shortly after moving on, I?m dropping the former set origin node. I suspect that?s why one of subscribers enters the perpetual ?MOVE_SET not received yet? loop, which I know isn?t a new slony1 problem. Is there any reason this shouldn?t work? The FAILOVER command never does this. In the scenario I?m working on, I would have liked to avoid the heavy hammer, but do I need to use FAILOVER to make this happen reliably?
                Thanks in advance,


--- slonik commands ----
lock set (id=1, origin=1);
move set (id=1, old origin=1, new origin=3);
