Subject: [Slony1-general] Inconsistent regex handling between SET ADD TABLE
	and SEQUENCE
Message-ID: <c92ccca1-2888-0849-b208-e197d47213e3@superhosting.cz>

Hello,


since Slony-I 2.1 a POSIX regular expresions can be used for adding 
tables and sequences to a replication set. I have tried to add all 
tables using Slony 2.2.5 documentation example of command SET ADD TABLE:

SET ADD TABLE (SET ID=1, TABLES='public\\.tracker*');

In this case backslash must be escaped to get intended regular expression.


Regular expresions used with SET ADD SEQUENCE doesn't works correctly 
with doubled backslash. To select all sequences from public schema plain 
regular expression must be used:

SET ADD SEQUENCE (SET ID=1, SEQUENCES='public\.*');


Shouldn't be both command handled consistently?

Yes, it probably should. This looks like a bug

Subject: [Slony1-general] Upgrading and partitioning question

Hello all,

I was wondering if anyone has found a clever way to upgrade to PostgreSQL 10 with the new partitioning design.

I have a database on 9.3 with some partitioned tables which I would like to upgrade to PostgreSQL 10 and take advantage of the new declarative partitioning. 
I was considering using slony for the upgrade and was wondering if there is a clever way to use declarative partitions directly or if I would need to do some conversions after upgrading. I am guessing I would need to convert the table after as I can not think of a way to incorporate it.

Thank you in advance for anyone's insight, comments or ideas!
