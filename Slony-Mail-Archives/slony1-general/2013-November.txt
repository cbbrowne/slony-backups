Subject: [Slony1-general] removing slony for dev database
Message-ID: <CEA7ACF9.7B93%mjames@profitpoint.com>

I did a pg_dump -s --exclude-schema=_slony_cluster db_name > outfile.ddl   And I'm restoring it to a server that I intend to use for dev testing. I don't need any of the slony objects for testing, is there a way to remove all of the slony1 objects in the dev database? No slon daemons running on the dev box. This is slony1-2.0.3. The production server is ubuntu 8.04, postgresql 8.3 and the dev server is ubuntu 12.04, postgres 9.3.1.

Thanks,
Mike

Search the archives for a script called slony1_extract_schema.sh which does
this for you.
