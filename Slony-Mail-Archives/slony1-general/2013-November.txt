of bugs including:

   - Bug 315 :: Fixes to compile time include directories

   - Bug 318 :: Fix to FAILOVER logic to avoid slon restart loop

   - Bug 319 :: Fix dereferencing of NULL pointer on a lost connection

Subject: [Slony1-general] removing slony for dev database
Message-ID: <CEA7ACF9.7B93%mjames@profitpoint.com>

I did a pg_dump -s --exclude-schema=_slony_cluster db_name > outfile.ddl   And I'm restoring it to a server that I intend to use for dev testing. I don't need any of the slony objects for testing, is there a way to remove all of the slony1 objects in the dev database? No slon daemons running on the dev box. This is slony1-2.0.3. The production server is ubuntu 8.04, postgresql 8.3 and the dev server is ubuntu 12.04, postgres 9.3.1.

Thanks,
Mike

Thanks, I found it. Looks like it will do exactly what I need.

Subject: [Slony1-general] measuring latency for log shipping
Message-ID: <CEB0DC3A.7F01%mjames@profitpoint.com>

I am using slony1 log-shipping to replicate some data to a remote location thru a VPN tunnel. A cron job running every minute applies the logs to the remote slave. So the latency is at least one minute. Is there a way to more precisely measure the latency between the origin and slave?

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [Slony1-general] Combining multi-master PG 9.3 with slony1
	replication
Message-ID: <CEB0DFD2.7F0F%mjames@profitpoint.com>

Hi, a general question to the list - has anyone tried to combine the postgresql multi-master replication with slony1 in any fashion? Specifically, I am thinking of having a small cluster of 3 cloud instances using multi-master, then using a slony1 log shipping solution to another location. The remote location will have tables needed for reporting that are not present in the clustered master instances.

All suggestions, observations are welcome. Thanks, Mike

I'd say that things are less deterministic than that, unfortunately.

The expected latency is actually more like 30 seconds, though there are
cases that could induce arbitrarily more.

"Why 30s?" is interesting...

Consider the scenario where there are generally small sets of changes being
applied, and replication is keeping up to date nicely.  Suppose, further,
there is one SYNC generated every second.

With your "apply once per minute" approach, consider when logs are being
applied at the top of the minute.  There are 60 logs there, one from a
minute ago, one from 59 seconds ago, and so forth.  There will be one log
that is just 1s old, so that the "latency" for that log will be just 1s,
considerably better than 1m.  On average, the latency, across the 60 logs,
will be 30s.

This indicates that the number you're measuring as "1 minute latency" isn't
an minimum (some logs will get applied almost instantly after generation,
if you're lucky), or a mean (the mean is likely around 30s, probably a
little more), but rather you are describing a "worst case latency."  At
worst, usually, you expect latency to be 1 minute.

Unfortunately, that's not nearly the end of the story.  By a suitable
pattern of updates, one may induce arbitrary increases to that "worst case
latency."

It's pretty easy to do: I just have to set up a transaction on the origin
that does a large amount of replicable work.
    BEGIN; UPDATE some_replicated_table SET [some change] WHERE [lots and
lots of tuples are affected]. COMMIT;

That set of work will go into the next SYNC that is generated immediately
after the COMMIT.  Supposing the set of updates takes 5 minutes to query
from sl_log_{1,2} and assemble into a log, and it takes 10 minutes to load
that on the remote slave, then we have just induced a latency of 15
minutes.  (That it's 5 minutes and 10 minutes for those activities is
purely made up on my part; it should nonetheless be easy to believe that if
you COMMIT a transaction that touched a million tuples in replicated
tables, it will take a while to process that.  Increase the number of
tuples as needed to get whatever result worries you most!)

Log shipping replicas are not known to the origin of a set. There are no
sl_confirm records for them. Only the slon deamon, writing the log
shipping files, knows that it is doing so. That node is by design a
replica itself and even it has no knowledge about who is possibly
consuming those log shipping files. To determine the lag between the
"origin" and a replica you need to know the current time on the origin
and the timestamp of the last SYNC event from that origin replicated to
the replica. Since log shipping replicas have no sl_confirm records,
there is nothing inside the Slony system that could answer that question.
