We do periodically check for regressions, and it is interesting that in
pretty well every major release, there is *some* regression due to
code moving around.

(I just did a run against HEAD, and will have to do something about
the fact that INT64_FORMAT has moved from pg_config.h to c.h.
So the tale continues even after 9.4!  :-) )

We are pretty careful about making sure of things once it comes
time for a major release to come out, as people certainly take
interest in Slony at such moments.
