	Thanks Steve. I should mention, the dependence on indirect subscribers for a successful failover may provide a scalability limitation for us. We?re required to complete failover reliably in just a few minutes. Getting acknowledgements from all the multiple geographically distributed nodes in the allotted timeframe has sometimes been challenging. Would this be a worthwhile Slony-I feature? I believe I could find time in my schedule to do the dev work myself, if that would be helpful.

If you remove the edge nodes from the admin conninfo section does this solve 
your issue? Does it introduce any other issues?

The trick is being able to figure out which nodes it actually needs to wait 
for and which ones don't.  Part of the problem is to think about how the 
edge nodes will catch up with the events they haven't yet processed if they 
then get the FAILNODE command earlier.

	This is something it seems we?ll need to test. Ideally, it would be great if nodes which don?t have any provider-subscriber relationships between them didn?t need to maintain state about each other at all.

In my pre-release testing I hit a bug where occasionally when running DDL 
submitted to a non set origin/non provider node the DDL is replicating twice 
to some other nodes.

The regression test testddl.js will occasionally hit this case and fail.

I don't think this is a new issue with 2.2.6.

I can

A) Release 2.2.6 anyway and we we will have another release when we fix the 
DDL issue.

B) Hold off on 2.2.6 until we have a better idea on a timeline for the fix.

Unless anyone is aching for a 2.2.6 release (speak up if so) I am inclined 
to go with B.

Message-ID: <CACe8ryyaYq8r9Ak1qTDmqGEjh_hwPHJ5T+wiv15dB66iMdr=iw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Is Slony 2.2.5 compilable with Postgres-9.6 64-bit binaries on Windows OS?
I successfully compiled with Postgres-9.3 64-bit binaries on Windows OS.

With Postgres-9.6 64-bit binaries, it gives me the following error after
typing "nmake /f win32.mak slon.exe" in the command prompt:

libpgport.lib(snprintf.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol
__imp__d
class referenced in function fmtfloat
slon.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio
11.0
\VC\BIN\amd64\link.exe"' : return code '0x460'
Stop.


I tried with Windows SDK 7.1, VS2012 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt
and VS2013 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt.


Thanks for the help.

I THINK you need to be using the same version of visual studio that was used 
to build the postgres you were using.

Perhaps it was VS2010?


I've hit the same error at times. When I was doing the pre release testing 
for 2.2.6 I hit that, but I didn't have the time to download + setup/try 
VS2010.

If you try different versions of visual studio please let the list know what 
works or doesn't.

I will try to find my old VS2010 to test. I'm able to compile Slony 2.2.5
on postgres-9.3 with VS2012 though. However, I really need postgres-9.6.

May I ask how you got around the issue when you hit the error?


Regards.

I didn't really work around it.
Since I was just checking to see if I introduced any compile errors with the 
slony 2.2.6 changes I stopped when I hit the error.

Ideally we can figure out what the issue is but I haven't yet been able to 
setup VC 2010 environment to check it out.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Slony 2.2.6 released
Message-ID: <59A3197C.9070904@ca.afilias.info>

The Slony team is pleased to announce Slony 2.2.6 the next minor release
of the Slony 2.2.x series

Slony 2.2.6 includes the following changes

     - slonik_build_env can now accept multiple -schema options on the 
command line
    - Support for PG10. This involved changes to PG version detection
    - Disallow createEvent and data changes in the same transaction.
      This also fixes some issues when the logApply trigger invokes the
      data change trigger by inserting into a table with a trigger that
      in turns inserts into another replicated table.
    - Fix some failover issues when doing a multi-node failover
      with a cascaded node.
    - Bug 341 - suppress log trigger/deny when running in 'local' mode
    - Fix issue when receiving DDL from non origin nodes


Slony 2.2.6 can be downloaded from the following URL
