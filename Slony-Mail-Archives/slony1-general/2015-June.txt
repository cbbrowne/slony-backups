Subject: [Slony1-general] bloat maintenance on slony internal tables
Message-ID: <CADyzmyysJxT+DgHUVZWV=KXTh=VPKg74WaL+wN6sso_iZmxy5g@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,

I track table bloat on all db tables on master and slave. Some of the slony
tables, notably sl_apply_stats and sl_components (on the slave) can grow to
1- 2 thousand times their original size due to bloat.  This is a condition
that has been prevalent for some time now.  Is there a utility that
I can run to clean this bloat out or do I need to resort to VACUUM FULL?

Thank you,

Are they continuing to grow, or does this become their "working" size? If
you vacuum them down, and they grow again, what really have you
accomplished? If they do not continue to grow, then there's no "bloat" but
just a large amount of space needed to operate.

Also, specifying your postgres + slony versions is always a good idea...

There's a lot of confusion about "bloat".

Keep things in persepctive: The two tables you mention will have very few
live rows and will be updated very frequently. As a result, unless your
autovacuum is very aggressive, they could easily "bloat" up to several
thousand times the size of the live rows, which could be wasted space of
several thousdand KILObytes. Oh God! The humanity.

I've yet to see a monitoring tool that warns about bloat in an
intelligent manner. That doesn't mean that none exist, but it means
that enough misleading ones exist that I've yet to find any useful
ones.

To get more to the point, the utility you should probably use is one
that interprets "bloat" in a manner that allows you to realize that
those two tables aren't worth worrying about.
