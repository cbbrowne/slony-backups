Subject: [Slony1-general] moving sl_log_1 and sl_log_2 tables
Message-ID: <CADyzmywSy_KxEmfEsNnHzuTSF8TcRFb0ih9R3OOACYSkYqgMig@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening,

We run slony 2.2.3 on a postgres 9.2 platform.  We would like to move the
sl_log_1 and sl_log_2 off the primary lun where the rest of the sl% tables
and the rest of the database.
The reason being is that we run processes that bloat these tables. We'd
like to move them to a less full lun if possible.  Could it be as simple as
copying the tables to the new lun and creating a synonym on the old lun
pointing to the copied table?

Any suggestions/recommendations welcome.  Thanks

If I'm understanding right, you probably want to create a tablespace on your new lun and then just move the tables over with ALTER TABLE SET TABLESPACE.

See:
    http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtablespace.html
