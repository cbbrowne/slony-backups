Subject: [Slony1-general] Creating triggers on replicated table
Message-ID: <CAHD_kvnd2SUgOUavpnEuuDr1Pe5Y_Y6V_Hu33k8tvK3ovu+JAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm able to create triggers on a non replicated DB. However, It does not
seem to work on
a replicated DB. I have a table A that is replicated to table B on another
machine. I want
to add a trigger in table B so that when a row is added in table B, it
notifies a program
that is listening. Unfortunately, the triggers that I implemented does not
seem to be raised
when the table is a replication of another. Is there any way around this?


Thanks.

Sung Hsin

See the "DISABLE/ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ] TRIGGER" section of
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/sql-altertable.html

You want your triggers to fire ALWAYS or only on the replica.
