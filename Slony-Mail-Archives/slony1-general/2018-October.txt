I have not had to use the resubscribe command since migrating to 2.2 and I am not quite understanding the docs. I am hoping someone can clarify how to use the call for me. 

I have 4 nodes

A is replicating to B and C and C is replicating to D.

I would like to resubscribe B so it is a receiver from C so A is the provider to C and C is the provider to B and D.

Would I run:

RESUBSCRIBE NODE  (
   ORIGIN = A,
   PROVIDER = C,
   RECEIVER = B
);
And it will resubscribe all the sets? What id I wanted to only resubscribe some sets? There does not seem to be an option for this like there was with using subscribe set(). I see the function for reshapesubscription which seems to be more in line with what I want but it does not seem to be a callable.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

I think you would first need to do

RESUBSCRIBE NODE  (
     ORIGIN = A,
     PROVIDER = A,
     RECEIVER = C
  );

So C is receiving the data from A directly

then you could do

RESUBSCRIBE NODE  (
     ORIGIN = A,
     PROVIDER = C,
     RECEIVER = B
  );

to point B at C.

If all your sets have A as the origin then they must all take the same route
to each subscriber.  You can't have some sets from A reach C through B and 
other sets from A reach C directly.

Thank you for your reply, I want to make sure I am absolutely clear before using the call on a production system so I have two questions.

1. Currently C is a receiver of A, do I still need to use 

RESUBSCRIBE NODE  (
   ORIGIN = A,
   PROVIDER = A,
   RECEIVER = C
);

Current:
A ------?> B 
        \__> C ??>D

Desired:

A ????>C ????>D
			   \_____>B


2. Calling resubscribe node as below will only change B?s provider on all sets and leave all other nodes as they are, is that correct?

RESUBSCRIBE NODE  (
   ORIGIN = A,
   PROVIDER = C,
   RECEIVER = B
);

Thank you,

Kacey

If C is already a direct subscriber to A then you don't need the above 
command.

Yes this should only change B's provider.

I encourage you to test this out on a test cluster with the same set 
and node topology as you'll be doing before trying this on production.
