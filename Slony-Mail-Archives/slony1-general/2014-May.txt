Sorry, I'm on bad form today, that should read:

"This time starting node 3 back up appears to *have* let slonik move on from the failover, but not complete because I'd inadvertently added in the drop node command too."

According to these pages:

http://yahoomail.tumblr.com/post/82426900353/yahoo-dmarc-policy-change-what-should-senders-do

They say this:

"*If you are a mailing list owner, what should you do?*

Mailing lists are a special case of sending mail on behalf of individuals.
The most common option is to use the mailing list?s address instead of the
sender?s on the From: line. This will change the reply behavior. Some
mailing lists also choose to act as pure forwarders and resend the mail
without breaking DKIM signatures. As of this publication, no common mailing
list packages provide straightforward configuration options that produce
DMARC compatibility, although Mailman has relevant features starting in
2.1.16. If you are a developer of mailing list software and would like help
adding features to allow participants from domains with DMARC p=reject,
please contact us at dmarc-help at yahoo-inc.com.

More information about the DMARC specification and implementation advice is
available at http://dmarc.org/"

It seems like they believe Mailman has started to support the requirement
capabilities in Mailman 2.1.16, and it is theoretically possible to support
the required capabilities. I guess it's a bit premature for them to make
the leap without being sure... but I do have sympathy for the idea that
somebody has to be first, and nothing will kick the various mailing list
software providers into adding support for DKIM signatures then breaking
them for a major source of emails...

I think my suggestion would be to make sure Slony is hosted by Mailman
2.1.16 or later, that some minimal effort is put into enabling the
capability they describe ("Not breaking DKIM signatures...") and if it's
not good enough, then so be it. Yahoo users can complain to their provider?
At least you tried, so it's not your fault?

This is a very poor hackaround and I am 100% against that. The message 
didn't come "From" the list (daemon), it came from a person. Every email 
software I've used in the past 25 years uses the From: header to 
generate the line you see at the top, reading

Note their wording, that 2.1.16 has "relevant features" but they don't 
know any package that actually works yet. I think my suggestion is to 
block Yahoo! senders and wait until there is an actual solution out 
there that is known to work.

I have to agree with this.  I think the people (Dave Crocker, note, is
one of them) who claim that mailing lists _are_ the source of the mail
are being technically correct at the expense of every user's model of
what's going on.  It's silly.

Note that, given the DMARC specification and the way DKIM works, there
will _never_ be an actual solution out there, short of "ignore the
validation rules whenever the mail comes from a list".  One solution
that is being offered is, "Whitelist all mailing lists and ignore
DMARC in that case."  Yeah, that'll scale.  

If we think there's a bad problem with this, and we don't want to move
the bounces back to individuals (by rewriting addresses to be
"yahoo.com.INVALID"), then tossing yahoo.com addresses (and any other
address that has the reject profile in place) is the only answer.

Best regards,

A

I see what is going on (based on the logs you sent that the list didn't 
like)


node 4 is configured to use node 2 as the provider for the set

Node 4 has the following in its event queue

1,5000000111 SYNC
.
.
1,5000000118 FAILOVER_NODE

remoteWorker_1 on node 4 doesn't process the FAILOVER_NODE because it 
can't get beyond the SYNC.  It can't get beyond the SYNC because the 
provider for 1 is 2 which has gone offline.

I *suspect* the attached patch might fix the issue, but I haven't yet

Testing shows that more is needed than just that  change.
I'll open a bug once I have a more refined patch.
