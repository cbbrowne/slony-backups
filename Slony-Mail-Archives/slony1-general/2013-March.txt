Subject: [Slony1-general] drop node
Message-ID: <51309A35.7040307@adyen.com>

All,

When you do a drop node (e.g. node 19), there can still be records for
that node in sl_confirm (both for con_received and con_origin.
Shouldn't the drop node command just delete those records ?

delete From _live_config.sl_confirm where con_received = 19;
delete From _live_config.sl_confirm where con_origin = 19;

Regards,

Ger

Yes, ideally after the DROP node has been confirmed by all other nodes 
then the records should be gone from sl_confirm on those nodes.

I have a feeling there might be a situation where a remote worker can 
pull in sl_confirms for node 19 from node 18 while the dropInt_int() is 
being processed on say node 17.

What version of slony are you using?

In the master/2.2 branch I added some code with the following comment to 
the drop_node function.


    /**
     * find the last event (including SYNC events)
     * from the node being dropped that is visible on
     * any of the remaining nodes.
     * we must wait for ALL remaining nodes to get caught up.
     *
     * we can't ignore SYNC events even though the dropped
     * node is not an origin it might have been an old
     * origin before a FAILOVER. Some behind node still
     * might need to get caught up from its provider.
     */

If a SYNC event from your node 19 is visible on ANY remaining node then 
it will should be confirmed by all other nodes before the drop_node gets 
submitted.

That logic is spread around a bit, and somewhat deferred.

See:
   function dropNode_int()
   function cleanupEvent()

The latter is the notable deferral; it's not desirable to drop the "entrails"
of node #19 immediately, as other nodes might still be working on
the last activity that had taken place on that node, so that the drop
mightn't take place "cleanly" if all the work takes place immediately.

Hi guys

Replication has died on my master-slave.

What i would really like to do is stop replication and then get it to clear out the replicated tables in the Slave and start again (i.e truncate the replicated tables ONLY ).

The problem I have is that only SOME tables are replicated between the Master and the Slave. 

- i do NOT want the replication to destroy the un-replicated tables on the Slave.

I have seen all the instructions on how to start replication but most of them have the step of drop the Slave db and re-import the schema from the Master. I can't do this as I don't want to clobber my un-replicated tables.

Is it possible to do what I want?

My initial thoughts were to do an slonik "unsubscribe set" and then do a slonik "subscribe set"

The problem I have is that the slon daemon on the Slave is erroring (see below), and from what I understand the "unsubscribe set" event will just be put in the event queue. I.e. The Slave will never be able to unsubscribe because it is erroring on an earlier event.

I was thinking there might be a way to delete all events in the queue so it could just continue ... is this possible? I realise that after that the data is not in sync, but im planning on blowing away the replicated tables and starting again anyway...

Although there might be a way to fix replication, i kind of want to know how to just do a "clean replication" from this point, as I see it as an important task.

Thanks for any thoughts/opinions.

Cheers

Jon

You did not tell us which version of Slony you are running. That is 
always good to include in a problem report. In this case it is 
especially relevant since the above is probably the result from doing 
some DDL on the replica (slave) directly, without sending it through 
slonik's EXECUTE SCRIPT functionality. My bet is that someone dropped 
and recreated the sequence in question. You can find out what sequence 
that is by doing

     SELECT * FROM "_replication".sl_sequence where seq_id = 10;

If you are still running Slony 1.2 then it is important to know what 
other DDL may have been executed on the replica since doing that in 1.2 
can lead to a permanently corrupted system catalog. There is no danger 
of that in 2.0 or 2.1.

Operations harmful on replicated tables on a replica under 1.2 include 
things like create/drop index, add/drop constraint, create/drop trigger 
as well as dropping columns.

If you conclude that your system catalog must still be consistent 
because you are running 2.0 or higher or none of the above has happened, 
then you can try to fix the problem first by running the slonik command 
REPAIR CONFIG against the replica node.

     http://slony.info/documentation/2.1/stmtrepairconfig.html

If that does not fix the problem, then you can uninstall Slony using the 
UNINSTALL NODE command for all nodes.

     http://slony.info/documentation/1.2/stmtuninstallnode.html

This does not touch any data on any of the nodes. It only restores 
things so that both systems at that point are stand alone databases.

After that you simply rebuild your replication cluster like it was done 
originally. Creating nodes, paths, sets, tables and subscribing them.

You do not need to truncate anything on the replica. Slony will take 
care of that.

If you have to go through that it would be a good opportunity to upgrade 
to Slony 2.1 while at it.

Jan

Hi Jan

Sorry for not including version, yup im 2.0.7 and pg 8.4.11.

That's good, at least I know no data has been corrupted.

As you say, I think DDL was run against the Slave by itself and i think it is corrupted. I don't think i can repair it because things were done against the Slave since then.

I am presuming the UNINSTALL NODE will bypass the slony event queue (which is blocked up with an error) ?

Thanks very much for your advice :)

Jon

Well, have you tried to run the REPAIR CONFIG slonik command for the set 
against the slave? The damage may not be as severe as you think.

What is the actual name of that sequence 10 according to sl_sequence? 
Does that sequence exist in the slave database?


>

UNINSTALL NODE is a command that actually removes all traces of Slony 
from a database. There should not be a slon daemon running at that time 
and you are left with a standalone database, that has no idea what Slony 
is at all.

Both databases would still have all your tables with whatever data is 
currently in them.

So you would stop the slon daemons, run UNINSTALL NODE against both, 
master and slave. Then rebuild your replication from scratch, just 
assuming that you don't have to copy any schema. The tables already 
exist on the slave, so there is not need to do that.

Most glad that it all turned out well.

Just for the record, did the REPAIR CONFIG do the trick or did you have 
to rebuild the cluster?

I had to rebuild the cluster, but I had messed with the tables before trying the repair, so I'm not surprised :)

Thanks

Jon

Most glad that it all turned out well.

Just for the record, did the REPAIR CONFIG do the trick or did you have to rebuild the cluster?

It appears that if you are using a 32-bit version of PostgreSQL you need the 32-bit version of the 2010 Visual C++ runtime.  If you are using a 64-bit version of PostgreSQL you need both the 32-bit & 64-bit version of the 2010 Visual C++ runtime.

I have no idea, the machine I usually do windows builds on has the SDK already installed.  If you figure out exactly what the runtime requirements are for a particular slony + VC + Windows version is please post them.

Dear experts,

We have implemented a table level replication between two sites.What are the
best methods to monitor slony replication.Thank you in advance.

Have you perchance consulted the documentation?

http://slony.info/documentation/monitoring.html

Preferred methods tend to depend on what kind of monitoring
infrastructure an organization themselves prefer, so all we can offer,
as a project, is a spectrum of events and facts that seem interesting
to collect.  You'd need to see how that maps onto your preferred
infrastructure.

Thanks for the valuable inputs.I had checked the documentation and looks like
nagios provides the end to end monitoring.
