Sorry for late on this, its due to actual Production swap implementation.
Though I tested as suggested, I didnt get time to post my reply.
After doing vigorous testing by taking into consideration Steve & Jan
points, we succeded it without any problem.

Yes, my analysis has flaw. Its no where related to SEQ.No...which I
analyzed and every node seq.no number is independed by itself.

To simulate this problem, Steve and I were pointing out, do the following:

Yep, I could able to detect before Step 5.

In short of our actual production swap, we stopped application(NO DML's)
and Slony. Checked DR-master(which is warm standby) is complete sync with
Master(primary). Promoted DR-master, did changes to store_path on both the
ends. Started slon on both the nodes. Sync catch-up well. We have taken
complete care of NOT happening any Step 2 or 3 though .. :)

Thanks once again.

Message-ID: <D7367DEE330645D8B0648399EA517120@CMOTUM25PC>

Hello. I?m testin Slony, everything is running fine in terms of replication, however I?m trying to test adding a column to a table that is beaing replicated.

I?m using altperl, so using the documentation I see that using slonik_execute_script should help me to create the new column.

This is how I am using it: 

slonik_execute_script 1 /root/script.sql

After I execute the script this message is shown:

cluster name = replication;
node 1 admin conninfo='host=192.168.20.144 dbname=nomina user=pgsql port=5432';
node 2 admin conninfo='host=192.168.20.210 dbname=nomina user=pgsql port=5432;
  execute script (
    set id = 1,
    filename = '/tmp/EpbvGiNpWb',
    event node = 1
  );

script.sql contains:  ALTER TABLE personas ADD COLUMN prueba integer;

However, nothing happens on the master or slave. 

Could you please, tell me what Im doing wrong?.

Thank you in advance.

You forgot to send the slonik script to slonik. IOW:

In 1.x yes. Since 2.0 DDL can be done directly with psql or by other 
means. If doing so, one needs to be careful which modifications are done 
to which nodes in which order so that inserts/updates aren't coming into 
a node with columns or things like that. But Slony by itself won't stand 
in the way any more.

Hi Jan,

I'm assuming most rules regarding replicated tables that applied in 1.x still apply in 2.0 though, i.e. slony still needs to know about extra colums added outside of execure script, primary keys etc.

Disregarding things such as trigger activity etc, isn't Vick's statement is still correct if the DDL changes the structure or primary keys of? the tables?? Slony needs to know about those changes.


We're on 2.0 and I've got a console that reads the slony configuration and allows our devs to execute a restricted set of DDL under their own credentials via a 2 phase commit, the rest is done via execute script.

I've sorted this.

For the record, I think the sequence of actions to cause this was:
  - Build the db schema on the slave database.
  - Install the debversion package on the slave server, installing its
.so and support files.
  - Attempt to set up slony replication

Those first two steps are obviously the wrong way around, yet I'm
pretty certain no errors were reported so I don't know what happened.
Dropping the new node and dropping the database, recreating it and
resubscribing worked fine.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Mismatch found between sl_table and pg_class

ACK

So everything was fine, replicating etc and I restarted postgres and
now I've got these errors.

WARNING:  table [id,nsp,name]=[116,publishers,dcm] - sl_table does not
match pg_class/pg_namespace
WARNING:  table [id,nsp,name]=[117,reportlogs,dcm] - sl_table does not
match pg_class/pg_namespace
WARNING:  Mismatch found between sl_table and pg_class.  Slonik
command REPAIR CONFIG may be useful to rectify this.

This is postgres 9.1.4 and slony 2.1.1.

I don't know what could be wrong, seriously it was fully replicated
until I restarted postgres just a few minutes ago.

We did an upgrade a week or so back from 8.4 to 9.1, using slon, and
switchover from one host to this host worked flawless, but now, what
exactly is it saying?

Thanks
Tory

Fedora
Postgres_9.1.4

I believe these errors are after up-gradation. You can run the health_check
function on the nodes and if error found, try to do REPAIR CONFIG as
mentioned in logs.

Health_check Function:

Thank you !!

Actually found it was tables that really shouldn't of been in there
and had at some point been removed, but they were still in the
sl_tables. A quick delete and things are back

Thanks for the rapid response!
