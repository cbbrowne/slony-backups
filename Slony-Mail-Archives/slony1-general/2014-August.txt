Subject: [Slony1-general] Initial sync copies tables infinitely
Message-ID: <1406887682-sup-6188@dual.evolix.net>

Hello,

I have a strange problem after adding a third node to my Slony cluster:

Up to now, I have a really simple Slony cluster: one master (node1), and one
slave (node2), which is subscribed to a unique set (set1). Everything
works fine for several years.
But now I have to add a second slave (node3) subscribed to the same set as
node2. So I followed the documentation?[1] to configure it and then started the
slon daemon on node3.
I see in the slon log file that tables are correctly copied.
Ok, I wait some days (about 50GB of data to copy), but here is the weird
problem: tables on the new slave seem to grow infinitely, but without data in
it!

Example with the table ?affectation?: normal size on master: 149MB.
But on the new slave:

    =# SELECT relname AS "relation", pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(C.oid)) AS "size"
      FROM pg_class C LEFT JOIN pg_namespace N ON (N.oid = C.relnamespace)
      WHERE nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema') AND relname='affectation';
      relation   |  size  
    -------------+--------
     affectation | 22 GB
    (1 row)

But the table is empty:

    =# select * from affectation;
     affectation_id | datedu | dateau | passager | produitchoisi 
    ----------------+--------+--------+----------+---------------
    (0 rows)

If a do a VACUUM on slave, all tables size goes to zero.

In the log file, tables are recopied each 11/12 minutes: 

    # grep '"public"."affectation"' /var/log/slony1/node3-gesto2.log
    [?]

    [?]

Note the correct table size (124742845 bytes) is copied.

To isolate the problem, I tried to create a new table, add it to a second set and
subscribe it to node3: everything ok, the copy process finish successfully. So
the problem seems to come from the set1 specifically.

All nodes run Slony 2.1.4 and PostgreSQL 9.3.4 under the same configuration.

Do you have any ideas about this problem?
It seems that Slony don't/can't acknowledge that tables are copied and so redo
the copy again and again.

Thanks for any hint about that.

I should expect that there'd be more in the log than that.

What you are showing seems perfectly appropriate; what I imagine is missing
is that at the end, something is going wrong, the set is treated as NOT
having subscribed successfully, and it (correctly, generally speaking)
tries again a bit later.

Unfortunately, the "something going wrong" is some persistent problem, so
the subscriptions to tables never succeed.

There should surely be more in the log.

Here's what the logs commonly look like at subscription time:

DEBUG2 remoteWorkerThread_1: Received event #1 from 5000000017

If you have logging turned way down so all you're seeing is CONFIG and
higher, you should nonetheless see the bulk of the above (and note the bits
*after* the last line indicating 0.167 seconds to copy table5).

If an error occurred, that should surely be logged, and that would be the
reason to not get the lines...

You have right, there is indeed an error message is the log? I haven't
seen it before because of a to high debug level and a huge amount of
tables and sequences in the set.

    2014-08-03 16:17:52 CEST CONFIG remoteWorkerThread_1: copy table "public"."selectiondeproduit_produit_map"
    2014-08-03 16:17:53 CEST ERROR  remoteWorkerThread_1: "lock table "_replication".sl_config_lock;select "_replication".setAddTable_int(1, 170, '"public"."selectiondeproduit_produit_map"', 'selectiondeproduit_produit_map_idx', 'Table public.selectiondeproduit_produit_map with primary key'); " PGRES_FATAL_ERROR ERROR:  Slony-I: setAddTable_int(): table "public"."selectiondeproduit_produit_map" has no index selectiondeproduit_produit_map_idx

The index of selectiondeproduit_produit_map has apparently been renamed on node1 but Slony was not been notified about this change and the old name is still present in sl_tables table.
I going to fix that.

Thanks for your help about this straightforward problem!

I don't think you will find pre-built binaries for any recent version of 
slony for Solaris SPARC.  Your best bet is to compile your own binaries from 
source.

What symbols is it having a problem referencing?  I suspect it says that 
somewhere in the error output from LD.

Any ideas as to how to establish this frequency?  I'm guessing the
simplest approach would be to look at checkpoint_timeout and do
something less than that.

Up in the air is under what circumstances, if any, adjusting this
dynamically would be worthwhile.  Intuitively, in situations where
checkpoints are happening with extreme frequency, adding even more
load seems like it might be a net loss, but again that's a thing that
should be measured under a reasonable sampling of high loads, not
intuited.

Cheers,
David.

What was the solution?

Do we need to make a change to the slony makefiles to get things to link 
properly on solaris sparc?

We had to add the following line in slonik.c file for successful
installation.

#include <alloca.h>

It is working on Linux without any issues. Not sure why.

Message-ID: <CAAMgDXkDv3FxCW0Ri4qwF=_W_i1tBSxe=HgctFM5fg8svXB=fA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I thought i got those cleanup event every 10 minutes, which is the default.
I desired another value for this parameter, but seems didn't work. I set
them to 20 minutes.
How can i change the value for cleanup event on slon process?

config :
cleanup_interval="20 minutes"

Message-ID: <CAMC-nfvn=kG+r=__ZnggwUBX1pSBrw6s8H7VZ36GiSd0Vh41YQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm trying to get a slony 2.2.3 cluster up and running on postgres 9.3.5,
and am running into the below error:

[postgres at localhost bin]$ ./init_cluster.sh ../etc/slony.cfg
<stdin>:305: loading of file /usr/pgsql-9.3/share//slony1_base.2.2.3.sql:
PGRES_FATAL_ERROR ERROR:  could not load library
"/usr/pgsql-9.3/lib/plpgsql.so": /usr/pgsql-9.3/lib/plpgsql.so: undefined
symbol: HeapTupleHeaderGetDatum
ERROR:  could not load library "/usr/pgsql-9.3/lib/plpgsql.so":
/usr/pgsql-9.3/lib/plpgsql.so: undefined symbol: HeapTupleHeaderGetDatum

Some system info:
cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.5 (Santiago)
(64 bit)

rpm -qa | grep slony
slony1-93-2.2.3-1.rhel6.x86_64

rpm -qa | grep postgres
postgresql93-devel-9.3.5-1PGDG.rhel6.x86_64
postgresql93-libs-9.3.5-1PGDG.rhel6.x86_64
postgresql93-9.3.5-1PGDG.rhel6.x86_64
postgresql93-contrib-9.3.5-1PGDG.rhel6.x86_64
postgresql93-server-9.3.5-1PGDG.rhel6.x86_64

I'm suspecting it's an issue with plpgsql itself, but not quite sure yet,
wondering if anyone has seen this recently.

Thanks,
- Brian F

Any chance you've got more than one set of postgresql packages installed?

What does:

ldconfig /usr/pgsql-9.3/lib/plpgsql.so

return?

ldconfig /usr/pgsql-9.3/lib/plpgsql.so returns nothing, and has a return
code of 0

I only see 93 installed via rpms, these are new machines so I wouldn't
expect some leftover installation from anywhere else.

Sorry, that was a typo on my part.

Shoul've said:

ldd /usr/pgsql-9.3/lib/plpgsql.so

Message-ID: <CAEyp7J_gp5M_GXE9uV2+msZ0bVfWYiQQDdT55VUhN89q3NSbqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

We have a situation where  Slony schema on a slave node was accidentally
dropped.

Is there any quick way around for this ?

We have a master replicating to 3 slaves and one of the slaves does not
have the Slony schema.

- Can we just un-subscribe that slave and resubscribe back to catch up with
the sync ?

In anyone faced such situation, please help us with this.

Regards,
VBN

You should issue a DROP NODE command for the slave that lost the schema 
(using another node as the event node).

You can then create the node again as a new node and resubscribe.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Slony-I Upgrade
Message-ID: <CAEyp7J9JXneFdqx3+4SXsJkqpMiQemB_pMOMsoWyQ2_fWrXcNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

We are upgrading our existing Slony-I installations across our production
servers.

We are upgrading from version 2.0.3 to version 2.2.3.

We will have our Applications down for an other scheduled activity

Below is our upgrade procedure -

   - Install Slony-I-2.2.3 on all the nodes
   - Issue SLONIK_UPDATE_NODES -c <config file>  from any of the nodes (we
   do it from our master node)
   - Start the slon processes for all the nodes

Will this be OK to upgrade from 2.0.3 to 2.2.3 ?

Please help us know if we have to do anything else.

Regards,
VBN

I never try the way You proposed. I think You better upgrade it with
smaller steps, (i.e 2.0 to 2.1 then 2.1 to 2.2) as described here :

Upgrading from 2.0.3 to 2.2.3 works fine.

So, I'm wondering why do we see undefined symbol even though pgport lib is
 included in the linking

Yes, there should be no difference between upgrading from 2.0 or 2.1 to 
2.2. The thing to keep in mind is that with 2.2 the structure of the 
sl_log tables changes and that it is absolutely necessary that the 
application is stopped and all subscribers are fully caught up before 
starting the upgrade process. Outstanding backlog is not being converted 
and those updates would be lost otherwise.

Jan

Subject: [Slony1-general] Unavailability of a node and time outs
Message-ID: <CAF51Zwzst57U2GgHb59gMqei4eK+vpxHEhEinUBDPGhPmN20iQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

The slony documentation mentions that Slony-I is a system designed for use
at data centers and backup sites, where the normal mode of operation is
that all nodes are available.

I am using slony to replicate the database between 2 nodes.In case the node
housing the master database is unavailable, does slony running on the node
running the slave database timeout trying to connect to the master database
or will it try to attempt connecting to the master database indefinitely?

When the mode housing the master DB is down, I am getting repeated "could
not connect to server: No route to host" logs on the slave node and it is
not entirely clear whether slony is generating this log or whether it is
because of some other psql command.

Regards,
Umang

slony will keep trying.

where are you seeing this message? perhaps you should check the slony
logs for what it is doing, and compare to wherever this other message
is appearing to see if they are at the same time slony does something.
