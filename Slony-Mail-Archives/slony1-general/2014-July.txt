Which version of slony are you on?

Master : Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Postgre 9.1.13, Slony 2.0.7 from Ubuntu Package
Slave : Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Postgres 9.1.13, Slony 2.0.7 seems build from
source.
DB size 1.5 TB, Master utilize relative high number of temp tables and
relative High number of locks on busy time

DB=# select mode, count(*) from pg_locks group by mode;
           mode           | count

 ShareLock                |  54906
 AccessShareLock          |  93607
(7 rows)

but the slave is relative low on load.

this is the connection from slave that open from May 25th
postgres 14090  0.1  1.1 4512644 230760 ?      Ss   May25  59:08 postgres:
slony_user dbname master_ip_address(58554) idle

On slave, this connection seems always keep on idle status, but on master,
this connection often in "<IDLE> in transaction" status for some minutes
and hold lock on sl_log_2 while transaction are filling up sl_log_1.

Such condition usually happen on server high load time, but on low load it
sometimes happen, but not many and does not affect on replication lag.

What is
select last_value from sl_log_status (it is a sequence) on the master 
when you see those "NOTICE:  Slony-I: could not lock sl_log_2 - sl_log_2 
not truncated" messages?

The sl_log_status value SHOULD be controlling both which (if any) tables 
the cleanup thread tries to lock/truncate and which of the log tables 
slon selects from.  It should be doing it such a way that the cleanup 
thread will never try to lock a table that slon is going to select from. 
Of course, there could be a bug here.

Also you should be aware of bug 167 (
http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=167) which exists in 
slony 2.0.x where if replication is behind (your sl_log tables grow 
large) then selecting from sl_log becomes a full table scan making 
replication very slow.  Bug 167 was fixed in 2.1

I should also point out that slony 2.0.x does not properly support PG 
9.1 or higher.  You should use slony 2.1.x or 2.2.x with PG 9.1+.

If you are seeing a lot of transactions being aborted due to 
serialization conflicts then this is because of the issues with PG 9.1 
and slony 2.0 (though it doesn't sound like that is causing this 
particular issue)
