Subject: [Slony1-general] slony 2.1.3 run with postgresql 9.3.4?
Message-ID: <CAEaSS0Y=wG4HduwcHpX1yWLqq-=zAY0JMBiMa7jmPy20__8wEA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm currently running 9.2.4 with slony 2.1.3.

I would like to use slony to upgrade my DB as i have for a few upgrades
now, but want to make sure that 2.1.3 supports 9.3.x, as I usually upgrade
postgres, then I upgrade slony.

I don't use pre-compiled binaries and I create a single rpm with
postgres/slon built together.
So my steps are usually roll out the new rpm to my slaves, drop and add,
they will then be getting data loaded as 9.3.4 wants it, but would still be
running slony 2.1.3.  After my query slaves and switchover slave are
updated this way, I switchover between my master (still running
9.2.4/2.1.3) and my slave (now running 9.3.4/2.1.3), and then I can drop
add the old master and bring it to 9.3.4/2.1.3).

Thanks

Tory

What does this ominous message mean

When Slony-I uninstalls itself, catalog corruptions are fixed back up.

Slony 1.x was designed to run on PostgreSQL versions prior to 8.3. Since 
the "session_replication_role" and trigger configuration features were 
new in 8.3, Slony 1.x disabled triggers and rewrite rules by hacking 
pg_class on replicas. When you use UNINSTALL NODE, those hacks are 
reverted and you end up with a clean system catalog again on that replica.

Thanks Jan,

I see if I squint and tilt my head a certain way that it reads correctly.

Is there a debian 2.x package for wheezy ?
