Subject: [Slony1-general] slony 2.1.3 run with postgresql 9.3.4?
Message-ID: <CAEaSS0Y=wG4HduwcHpX1yWLqq-=zAY0JMBiMa7jmPy20__8wEA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm currently running 9.2.4 with slony 2.1.3.

I would like to use slony to upgrade my DB as i have for a few upgrades
now, but want to make sure that 2.1.3 supports 9.3.x, as I usually upgrade
postgres, then I upgrade slony.

I don't use pre-compiled binaries and I create a single rpm with
postgres/slon built together.
So my steps are usually roll out the new rpm to my slaves, drop and add,
they will then be getting data loaded as 9.3.4 wants it, but would still be
running slony 2.1.3.  After my query slaves and switchover slave are
updated this way, I switchover between my master (still running
9.2.4/2.1.3) and my slave (now running 9.3.4/2.1.3), and then I can drop
add the old master and bring it to 9.3.4/2.1.3).

Thanks

Tory
