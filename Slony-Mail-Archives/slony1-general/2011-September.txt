Subject: [Slony1-general] trying to use pg_upgrade for 8.3 database with
	Slony 2.0.7
Message-ID: <954037A4-2219-4FFE-8336-F9FF3A5FFFCD@millburncorp.com>

As was discussed in a previous thread here, pg_upgrade complains that the following slony tables/columns can't be migrated from 8.3.x to 9.0.x:

> sl_table.tab_relname
> sl_table.tab_nspname
> sl_table.tab_idxname
> sl_sequence.seq_relname
> sl_sequence.seq_nspname
> vactables.relname

I'd still like to use pg_upgrade on a large 8.3.x database that uses slony 2.0.7. if I do the following actions:

1) stop slony;
2) alter table sl_table alter column tab_relname type text, alter column tab_nspname type text, alter column tab_idxname type text;
    alter table sl_sequence alter column seq_relname type text, alter column seq_nspname type text;
    drop type vactables cascade;
    CREATE TYPE vactables AS (
        nspname text,
        relname text
   );
   create function tablestovacuum () ? leaving out function body?

3) pg_upgrade

4) start 9.0, do vacuuming analyze, etc?

5) fix slony back:

  alter table sl_table alter column tab_relname type name, alter column tab_nspname type name, alter column tab_idxname type name;
    alter table sl_sequence alter column seq_relname type name, alter column seq_nspname type name;
    drop type vactables cascade;
    CREATE TYPE vactables AS (
        nspname name,
        relname name
   );
   create function tablestovacuum () ? leaving out function body?

6) then start slony

Does anyone know if this works? I'm going to try this on a test cluster tomorrow, but wondering if anyone has done this already.

Thanks,

Norman Yamada

In addition to the issues you have discussed you will also have to make 
sure that the 64 bit version of the xid's post upgrade are newer than the 64 
bit versions after.  You might not see this issue on a new test cluster, 
you would only see it on a cluster that has had the 32 bit xid wrap around 
at least once.

An upgrade from 8.3 to 9.0 also will require you to make sure that the 8.4 
version of the slony stored functions are installed not the 8.3 one.

I have not tried upgrading a slony cluster with pg_upgrade, so there might 
be additional issues still.

Thanks, Steve, but I'm not feeling very cheery now..
 
1) The sl_log_1 table has xid's in the range of 260914376 or so? Now the master node is staying on 8.3 for the moment; so I guess we're ok until we move it over.. but then what? what are the implications if the sl_log_1 table has transactions with lower xids in it? can we avoid problems if we make sure all nodes are up to date before the migration of the master node (and hence sl_log_1 is empty?)

2) How do I get the 8.4 version of the slony stored functions installed on the node that's moving up from 8.3 to 9.0? Once I pg_upgrade the box, and recompile and install slony for 9.0, will an update_functions suffice?

Thanks,

Norman

This issue was discovered by someone who upgraded via pg_dump and ended up 
with rows in sl_log_1 that were preventing the cleanup thread from 
truncating sl_log_1 so there sl_log_2 grew to be pretty big because a log 
switch couldn't complete.

If both sl_log_1 and sl_log_2 are empty on all nodes when you shutdown for 
the upgrade then you *might* be okay (off the top of my head I don't see 
other things that would break, but I was surprised when I discovered most 
of the other issues mentioned). I would also let a SYNC be processed 
and confirmed by all nodes before you start adding in new rows to sl_log_1 
(I am not sure how the logic that selects the transactions that committed 
between two SYNC events would deal with the xid list in the SYNC event list 
travelling backwards).

The slonik UPDATE FUNCTIONS command should install the correct version of 
the stored functions if you run it after the upgrade.

Just to complete this thread -- I tried the method I outlined in my previous email on a test cluster where I ran the following script on the node before I ran pg_upgrade:

> 1) stop slony;
> 2) alter table sl_table alter column tab_relname type text, alter column tab_nspname type text, alter column tab_idxname type text;

and it failed -- in an interesting way -- the node replicated one insert statement; and after that swallowed all replication events silently.

For the moment, I'm going to have to upgrade the node when I can stop all write activities to the master node. I'll drop the node out of the slony set before I run pg_upgrade; upgrade it to 9.0 and then resubscribe it to the slony set using the omit copy flag. I've tested this now on a test cluster; and this works.

Message-ID: <1315478555.24152.YahooMailNeo@web26003.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi Guys,

Since we were on slony 1.2 I've been doing full pg_dumps from our servers, and restoring them onto a test setup daily.

Since we've moved to 2.0 I've noticed that those full dumps now cause the subscribers to lag.? I just wanted to ask - is this expected behaviour in 2.0? And is the only real workaround skipping the schema during pg_dump?

It appears to me that cleanupEvent() is waiting for exclusive access to something in the slony schema.? An uneducated guess is that it's going to be that cleanupEvent() is calling logswitch_start() or logswitch_finish() and they are trying to lock sl_config_lock which is blocking. In turn cleanupEvent() can't commit some other update it's done causing createEvent() to block also?


Am I wrong in thinking cleanupEvent() didn't used to kick off the logswitching in 1.2?? And am I oversimplifying things by saying why can't the logswitch functions just add NOWAIT when trying to lock sl_config_lock, and skip it if an exception is raised?? Or am I just totally wrong?



Thanks
Glyn

Yes this is expected behaviour.  The only work around is to skip the 
slony schema in pg_dump.

The issue isn't the cleanup event as much as it is the SYNC event.
When slony generates a SYNC event it gets an exclusive lock on sl_event.
It can't get this exclusive lock if a pg_dump is running that has read 
sl_event.  Changing the cleanupEvent() code won't change this.

Slony 1.2 and 2.0 both behave this way, this shouldn't be new behaviour 
with 2.0.

In Slony 2.1.0 the SYNC event gets the lock on sl_event_lock a table 
that stores no data and is only used for locking.  You could then 
exclude just that table from pg_dump but I don't see a lot of value of 
dumping sl_event anyway.

Notably, the --exclude-schema option was added to pg_dump specifically
to facilitate Slony users.

Hmm, my nagios graphs disagree (or for some reason were oblivious), we check syncs every 10 minutes and they only started showing warnings the night after we moved to 2.0. The check is basically just looks at sl_status, and flags up a problem if st_lag_num_events or st_lag_time go over a threshold via the following query.


??? SELECT st_origin, st_received, st_lag_num_events, round(extract(epoch from st_lag_time)) 
??? FROM "<my_replication_cluster>".sl_status;

A graph for the weeks leading up to and after the upgrade is attached.? I upgraded on the night of the 25th/26th and ignoring any other downtime where I was obviously fiddling with things, you can see the syncs going out after that date.? As you can imagine, I'm massively embarrassed that it took me 3 months to notice it happening.

As the author of said feature, I can assure it was not done with Slony 
in mind. But I'm happy that it helps Slony users. :)

I disagree as well.  We still run 1.2.x and I never get replication

Great to hear I'm not the only one then Vick.

When we were on 1.2 I purposefully used to dump the slony schema so that we could restore from our subscribers data and use slony baremetal functions to fix the schema corruption automatically.

st_lag_time is a measure of the difference between now() and the last 
unconfirmed event.  The pg_dump locks sl_event which prevents the SYNC's 
from being created so there might not be any unconfirmed events to be 
measured by this check.



Sometime between 2.0.4 and 2.0.6 we fixed a bug that prevented SYNC 
events from being generated from pure slaves. I suspect your check is 
now measuring the other half of replication (if you do your select from 
sl_status you should see at least two rows, it isn't clear if your 
graphing both of them or just one).

If  now()-st_last_event_ts gets too high it means that SYNC events are 
not being generated.  You might want to alert on both SYNC events not 
being generated and events not being confirmed.

Okay, you know better than me.? However I'm positive that when we were on 1.2 and I was in overnight our slaves were up to date whilst the backups were running, it's only circumstansial of course, but pretty sure I'd have noticed in 3 years if not as I'd query those slaves all the time.

I've excluded the slony scchema from the dump now, so we're all good anyway.? 

Thanks

Subject: [Slony1-general] documentation bug in WAIT EVENT?
Message-ID: <4E6DFDD9.3050808@fifthhorseman.net>

Hi folks--

i just reported this on #slony, but it was odd hours and i suspect it
might get lost in the IRC backlog, so i'm posting it here:

At the bottom of:

   http://slony.info/documentation/2.0/stmtwaitevent.html

it says: "In order to more reliably monitor from within a slonik script
that SLONIK SUBSCRIBE SET is complete, you may submit a SLONIK SYNC
event after the subscription, and have the WAIT request wait on the SYNC
event, as follows. "

But then the example that follows does not include any SYNCs.  I don't
know how to interpret it, but the example and the text seem to be in
disagreement.

It's probably worth modifying it to either correct the example or to
make the description less misleading.

Thanks for slony!

I have been periodically doing builds and *some* testing against Git
Master; there have been a number of patches going in, now and again,
as issues have been found.

The most recent was a "9.2" issue:
http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=slony1-engine.git;a=commit;h=a7e9bcbccac54dfefe4b63db822e386d0c705e3e

That patch exists on both "master" and "2.0" branches, past, at this
point, any releases.  Of course, that's a 9.2-ism, so *newer* than 9.1
:-)

There aren't any 9.1-related fixes that aren't in releases.

I'd expect 2.0.7 to work fine with PG 9.1.

I'm less sure about 1.2.22; it's worth trying to build it.  I'd think
it likely that it would work.

You don't tell us which version of slony you are using.
resetSession is a new function that was added sometime during the 2.1.0 
betas.

Is it possible that you are trying to use the 2.1.0 slony_funcs.sql file 
with a slony 2.0.x shared library.  It *looks* like that from your 
output  but if there is  another issue with 2.1.0 we'd like to know 
about it.

As Chris said both of us have done testing against 9.1 betas with 2.1.0 
and 2.0.7.  You will see the "Possible unsupported PostgreSQL 
version..." message because we didn't want to remove that until 9.1 was 
actually released.

I've been playing with 9.1 and slony 2.1.0 betas.
Without digging into the code again (I can if you want) there are two 
places where it checks the server version number (major.minor in the 
form of 90100 I think) but treats anything above 90000 as unsupported 
and goes for 8.4 support... which doesn't work.
I manually changed those points to be 90100 and it worked like charm.

OK, it's slonik.c 1909 and 1995 in beta1.... I guess that could be 
different in more recent versions.

         else if ((adminfo->pg_version >= 90000) && (adminfo->pg_version 
< 90100)) /* 9.0 */

I changed the second version to 90200 to include all v9.1s, might be 
right, might not.

This change will only remove the 'warning message' inside that if blocks 
  does the same thing for 8.4, 9.0 and anything unrecognized (ie 9.1) 
other than the warning message.

Thanks for playing around with 2.1.0 betas.  I love to hear positive 
test reports.

both servers have slony v 2.0.7

PostgreSQL versions:
master = 9.1RC1
slave   =  9.0.4


However, let me say that there are a few other devs with their hands on 
this box.  I'll do a full clean reset of the slony and postgres installs 
and let you know where I end up.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Errors adding a 3rd slave with SLONY 2.0.7
Message-ID: <4E70F8CB.2090208@consistentstate.com>

Hi All;

I'm getting this error:


<stdin>:8: PGRES_FATAL_ERROR load '$libdir/slony1_funcs';  - ERROR:  
could not access file "$libdir/slony1_funcs": No such file or directory
<stdin>:8: Error: the extension for the Slony-I C functions cannot be 
loaded in database 'dbname=node3_5434 host=localhost port=5434 user=slony'


Here's what I did:

1) installed both postgres versions 9.0.4 and 9.1.0 in different 
directories on the same Linux server

2) initialized and started (2) 9.1.0 clusters on ports 5432 and 5433

3) initialized and started one (1) 9.0.4 cluster on port 5434

4) did a full slony setup on the 2 9.1.0 instances (master on port 5432 
and slave on port 5433) with no issues

5) setup the DDL on slave #2, the 9.0.4 instance and try to execute the 
script including the below code block, gives me the error (variables are 
set correctly):


slonik <<_EOF_

cluster name = $CLUSTERNAME;


node 1 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$NODE1_DBNAME host=$NODE1_HOST 
port=$NODE1_PORT user=$REPUSER';
node 3 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$NODE3_DBNAME host=$NODE3_HOST 
port=$NODE3_PORT user=$REPUSER';

store node (id=3, comment = 'NODE 3', event node = 1);

store path (server = 1, client = 3, conninfo='dbname=$NODE1_DBNAME 
host=$NODE1_HOST port=$NODE1_PORT user=$REPUSER');
store path (server = 3, client = 1, conninfo='dbname=$NODE3_DBNAME 
host=$NODE3_HOST port=$NODE3_PORT user=$REPUSER');

_EOF_


Thoughts?


Thanks in advance...

You didn't include the steps of when you compiled and installed slony. 
Since it can't find the shared functions file (slony_funcs.so) in your 
postgresql libe directory maybe you missed this.

2. ./configure --with-pgconfigdir=/usr/local/pgsql90/bin
make clean
make install
3. ./configure --with-pgconfigdir=/usr/local/pgsql91/bin
make clean

If you have 2 (or more) PG installations on a system, it is important to build Slony using --with-pgconfigdir for each one, Slony is going to be used with.

aah, I think this may be the issue. I din one install of slony against 
the 9.1.0 instance (./configure 
--with-pgconfigdir=/usr/local/pgsql-910/bin) and used it for all 3 
instances.


Thanks I'll give it a shot and report back

Hi All;

I have a 3 node cluster which is up and replicating.  I'm using slony v 
2.0.7 and postgres 9.1.0 on nodes 1 and 2 plus postgres 9.0.4 on node3.

I have a simple switchover script, see below for the script listing.
when I run it I get this:


$ ./sl_switchover2

Subject: [Slony1-general] pgbench Breaks SLONY!
Message-ID: <4E72B4F1.4020002@consistentstate.com>

Hi all;

I have a 3 node cluster as follows:

SLONY 2.0.7 on all three nodes, each install of slony was built on each 
node via source

nodes 1 & 2 = postgres 9.1.0

node3 = postgres 9.0.4

I did this:


1) I used pgbench -i to initialize the master database before I setup & 
started replication

2) I created a new column as a primary key on the pgbench_history table 
like so

alter table pgbench_history add column pgb_hist_id serial;
alter table pgbench_history add primary key (pgb_hist_id);


4) then I ran pgbench like this:
  pgbench -t 800 rep_bench_node1


5) after replication was started both slaves sync'd up fine

at this point all 3 nodes have 800 rows in the pgbench_history table

6) then I run pgbench again, reducing the number of tx thus reducing the 
overall number of rows in the pgbench_history table

$ pgbench -t 300 rep_bench_node1
starting vacuum...end.
transaction type: TPC-B (sort of)
scaling factor: 1
query mode: simple
number of clients: 1
number of threads: 1
number of transactions per client: 300
number of transactions actually processed: 300/300
tps = 265.106193 (including connections establishing)
tps = 285.114730 (excluding connections establishing)


7) the master (node1) now has 300 rows in the pgbench_history table
    however both slaves now have 1100 rows (it didn't do the delete on 
the slaves)

    at this point each subsequent run of  "pgbench -t 300 
rep_bench_node1" replaces the rows in node1 but appends another 300 rows 
to each slave.




Thoughts?

Am I doing something wrong?


Thanks in advance

Does pgbench use truncate?  I know slony 1.2 has issues with truncate.

Pgbench in more current versions (>= 8.4 I think) uses TRUNACTE on the 
history table.

Hi St?phane,

Slony-ctl is a great tool, more usefull then altperlscript.

The only problem is that "drop set" is missing but that's not really a
great problem :)

That's the reason why I've done the PDF. When I have time I will do the PDF
for README.en.

For the moment, I've tryed to modify it when you've got severals tables in
several schemas to replicate.

My idea is to add a schema as a simple set to replicate.

As a consequence, I've added a flag -p to create_slon.sh.

Ad a consequence when I have to add a new schema (a new schema = a new set
to add to replication)

./31_create_set.sh -c <instance> -s <set_num> -p <schema_to_replicate>
./32_exec_set.sh -c <instance> -s <set_num>

Then I've added the flag to create_slon.sh

I've done my tests for Slony 2.0.6 for the moment with PostgreSQL Plus
Advance Server 8.4 

I have to tests with Slony 2.0.7 too.

Hi 

I've begun to test Slony 2.0.7 a couple days ago. 
I've read the Slony documentation and see on the source for
clean_thread.c for vac_frequency 

However, I've got a question 

What happens if I put both on master and slave 

1) 

 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_event SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_confirm SET (autovacuum_enabled=off); 
2) vac_frequency=3 or vac_frequency=0 ? 

For your information, I use PostgreSQL 8.4, Slony 2.0.7. Autovacuum
is on both master and slave. 
If I have understood, 

vac_frequency=0 implies that SLony will not used his "own"
maintenance operation and just do a analyze if required 
Let me know.

Well 
I've did a test preventing autvacuum vacuuming Slony's tables using
both master and slave 

 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_nodelock SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_setsync SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_table SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_sequence SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_node SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_listen SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_path SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_subscribe SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_set SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_event SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_confirm SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_seqlog SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_registry SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_seqlastvalue SET
(autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_config_lock SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_archive_counter SET
(autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_status SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_log_1 SET (autovacuum_enabled=off);
 ALTER TABLE _mycluster.sl_log_2 SET (autovacuum_enabled=off); 

and with vac_frequency = 3 (both on master and slave in slon
configuration file) 

As a consequence Slony, is doing the "vacuum analyze" himself 

Here is what I see on the log (slave) 

2011-09-21 13:18:24 CEST[11540] DEBUG1 cleanupThread: vacuum  analyze
"_mycluster".sl_archive_counter;
2011-09-21 13:18:24 CEST[11540] INFO   cleanupThread:    0.648
seconds for vacuuming
2011-09-21 13:50:59 CEST[11540] DEBUG1 cleanupThread: vacuum  analyze
"_mycluster".sl_event;
2011-09-21 13:50:59 CEST[11540] DEBUG1 cleanupThread: vacuum  analyze
"_mycluster".sl_confirm;
2011-09-21 13:50:59 CEST[11540] DEBUG1 cleanupThread: vacuum 
analyze
"_mycluster".sl_setsync;
2011-09-21 13:50:59 CEST[11540] DEBUG1 cleanupThread: vacuum  analyze
"_mycluster".sl_seqlog;
2011-09-21 13:51:00 CEST[11540] DEBUG1 cleanupThread: vacuum  analyze
"_mycluster".sl_archive_counter;
2011-09-21 13:51:00 CEST[11540] INFO   cleanupThread:    0.697
seconds for vacuuming 

So for vac_frequency = 3, this is the response to my question :) 

I will wait the end of the test to see if I've got a deadlock or not
:)

Are you using yum.pgsqlrpms.org as the repository URL? (You can check it
under /etc/yum.repos.d/pgdg* ? If so, that repo is deprecated. The new
repo URL is

yum.pgrpms.org
or 
yum.postgresql.org

So, please change the URL first. Current package in the new repo is
2.0.7, and does not have that issue.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Dropping Replication schema on slony 1.2.21
Message-ID: <CAHFJsA-GVQrOWMZHgmZZ-j5pBLS4KVsBhEFVpWOi6uaehFpPwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I started a replication between master and a slave using slony 1.2.21. The
replication went succesfully and then i killed the slon daemons on both
machines. After that i wanted to remove the _replication schemas from the
database to remove all the traces of the replication schema and tables from
the database. So i went ahead and did "Drop schema _rep_cluster CASCADE" on
the slave first. It removed _rep_cluster schema from the slave completely
and then i went to do the same on the master node but there i was stuck on -
ERROR: "table_pkey" is an index. Now 'table' is the name of one of my tables
on the database and table_pkey is the associated primary key with it i
guess.

Has anybody seen this error before? Did the slony lock down itself because i
did not remove the schema correctly?

Currently there is a fully functioning replication going on from slave to
master with a different rep_diff_cluster for tables(a , b) and then from
master to slave for different 2 more tables (c, d) which is the main
replication we wanted after the initial small replication from master to
slave( a, b) (whose schema i wanted to remove from the databases completely)

Regards
Dilraj Singh

It is a well known problem that prior to version 2.0 Slony modified the 
system catalog and dropping the slony schema in the way you did left the 
system catalog in a corrupted state with no (easy) way to fix it.

The way to uninstall Slony up to version 1.2 is documented here:

Hi.

slonik works fine, but its echo output is screwed where some random
string is being used instead of the filename. Having only run slony
with Ubuntu 64bit packages, I don't know if this is a know issue or
bad packages (I believe the packages are brought in from Debian
unmodified):

$ slonik u2_newslave.sk
:1: Waiting for sync
:4: Synced
gen_newslave.sk:3: Adding node 2
gen_newslave.sk:5: Creating paths
Subscribing node 2:1: Waiting for sync
Subscribing node 2:4: Synced
/lib/libnsl.so.1:10: Subscribing node 2
/lib/libnsl.so.1:13: Subscription created. Slave is copying data.
Master can go live.

I don't recognize it as a known issue, it might be an unknown issue 
unrelated to the packaging.  You don't tell us what version of Slony you 
are using or provide the contents of your u2_newslave.sk so we know what 
slonik commands are being run at which line.

I can't replicate your issue but looking at the code I think I can see 
how using multiple includes can hit a bug that would sometimes result in 
your output.

I have created a bug for this and put my thoughts in at 
http://bugs.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=241

Thanks for the report.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Slony Problem
Message-ID: <10278367.784681317284881828.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hi,
i have some problems with slony 2.1.0. I have 2 server (192.168.22.225 Master, 
192.168.22.226 Slave) .
I run the following  cluster.sh  into main server:

CLUSTER=sql_cluster_test
DB1=test_grade
H1=192.168.22.225
H2=192.168.22.226
DB2=test_grade
U=xxxx
P=xxxx
/usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin/slonik <<_EOF_
cluster name = $CLUSTER;
node 1 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB1  host=$H1  user=$U password=$P';
node 2 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB2  host=$H2  user=$U password=$P';

init cluster (id = 1, comment = 'Master Node');
create set (id = 1, origin = 1, comment = 'contact table');
########TABLES###############################
set add table (set id = 1, origin = 1, id = 1,
        full qualified name = 'public.testtable',
        comment = 'Table testtable');
....
...

 then i run:

/usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin/slon sql_cluster_test "dbname=test_grade 
user=xxxx" > slon1.log &

in a master server and

usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin/slon sql_cluster_test  "dbname=test_grade 
user=xxxx" > slon1.log &

in slave server without  errors. At the end i run the following  
subscribe_test.sh script:


CLUSTER=sql_cluster_test
DB1=test_grade
H1=192.168.22.225
H2=192.168.22.226
DB2=test_grade
U=xxxx
P=xxxx
/usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin/slonik <<_EOF_

cluster name = $CLUSTER;

node 1 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB1 host=$H1   user=$U';
node 2 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB2 host=$H2   user=$U';

subscribe set (id = 1, provider = 1, receiver = 2, forward = no);

_EOF_

This is the returned message :

waiting for events  (2,5000000001) only at (2,0) to be confirmed on node 1
waiting for events  (2,5000000001) only at (2,0) to be confirmed on node 1
...
..

and the replication in slave tables aren't available and the replication 
systema doesn't work.

Please let me know if i'm doing some mistakes.

Thanks

Franesco
