Hi, Steve.

Thanks for the insight, and your explanation sounds very reasonable.

That's very good to hear. We'll look into possibilities of testing the
2.2b version.

Again, thanks!

Subject: [Slony1-general] Using Slony to migrate from PostgreSQL 8.2 to 9.2
Message-ID: <504857BF.8070906@postgresql.fr>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello,

I currently have a 1.2 slony cluster replicating PostgreSQL 8.2 databases.

On our way to migrate to PostgreSQL 9.2, we would like to use Slony to ease
the migration process.

But, I wonder which version of Slony I could use, as the version currently
used won't compile vs PostgreSQL 9.2rc1. Neither would slony 2.1.2 compile
with PG 8.2.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Regards,
