Due to the usage of capital letters in the slony cluster execute script
fails.

I am looking to replicate execute script for DDL changes. From what I can
see execute script takes a lock out on sl_lock before executing the script,
and releases it at the end.

What else am I missing ?

AFAICT, your replication falls behind because it has a lot of work to do.
Setting a non-zero statement_timeout prevents it to fully propagate data changes.

Well it looks like ddlscript_complete calls updateRelname() and repair_log_triggers(true), so I guess that's part of it.  


Wouldn't it be better to try and patch execute script to handle your case sensitivity issue?

Actually I think it has been fixed in bug 349 (Thanks Chris) However I'd
like to integrate schema changes into something like flyway.
https://github.com/flyway/

Not sure how this best plays out yet.

While I see the merit in this from your POV it is rather "blocky" and sort

Yes, this is where I was headed. Unfortunately flyway appears to call their
hooks as a transaction. I have asked them to provide a hook without a
transaction.

Any reason why you couldn't have a stable API here. Somewhat higher level
than the current functions which would allow you to still do whatever you
wanted below this layer ?

I think it would be great to see slony support in some schema management 
tools such as flyway,alembic or liquibase

I see two approaches worth considering

1) Have the schema managment tool Call the slonik executable and pass in 
a slonik script.

2) Call the SQL stored procedures directly.  This would involve calling
_slonyschema.ddlCapture for each SQL statement.  Then calling 
ddlScript_complete()

I would recommend against trying to duplicate the functions in ddlScript 
capture or ddlScript_complete.  I'll describe what they do in 2.2
for interest sake but I don't see any reason why you would want to 
re-invent this code.

The advantage of just using option 1 is that we (the slony developers) 
try to keep the slonik command syntax somewhat stable between releases 
but we reserve the right to change the API of the stored functions as we 
desire.  We don't consider the stored functions a stable API.
The pg-admin folks use the stored functions directly and keeping 
pg-admin working with the various slony versions and API changes
in something they need to keep on-top of.  You would have to take on a 
similar responsibility.

If you to teach your schema management tool to do more than just DDL but 
also do things like add new tables to a
replication set then the job of doing this directly with the stored 
procedures becomes larger.  Slonik often does more than just call the 
stored functions.


Here are the major steps the ddlScript_capture stored function performs 
when submitting DDL to run on all nodes

  * Captures the values of any replicated sequences
  * Inserts the ddl into the sl_log_script table
  * Executes the DDL submitted

The ddlScript_complete call will then
  * Add a row to sl_log_script indicating the DDL is complete
  * Call the updateRelName functions to check for any table renames
  * Call repair_log_triggers to fix the kkvv encoding for the trigger 
arguments

What do you mean 'as a transaction'  I think you could do those commands 
as part of larger transaction.

The EXECUTE SCRIPT cases are an easy example (in slony 2.2+) because 
they don't generate any events or involve waiting for events.  I think 
you could call those functions as part of a larger migration operation.

A much harder case is 'create a table, and add it to my existing 
replication set'.

The slonik for this would look something like

create set(id=1234, origin=1);
set add table(set id=1234, fully qualified name='public.some_new_table');
subscribe set(set id=1234, provider=1,receiver=2);
--repeat the subscribe set for all nodes that get the set
merge set(id=1,add id=1234, origin=1);


Slonik will issue many different stored function calls, commit 
transactions , wait for things to replicate and then move onto the next 
command.    Your not going to be able to do something like above as part 
of a single-uncommitted transaction.  Even if we had a stable API the 
burden of calling those functions , in the right order , at the right 
time, against the correct node isn't trivial (slonik.c is over 6000 
lines of code)



In the past I've thought about creating something like a pl/slonik.

Maybe where the admin conn_info strings are available somewhere on each 
database server then you do something in SQL like

DO $$

   create set(id=1234, origin=1);
   set add table(set id=1234,
       fully qualified  name='public.some_new_table');
   subscribe set(set id=1234, provider=1,receiver=2);
   --repeat the subscribe set for all nodes that get the set
   merge set(id=1,add id=1234, origin=1);
$$ language plslonik;


This still couldn't be transactional, the pl/slonik interperter would 
then need to open up libpq connections to both the local database and 
all the remote databases using the admin conninfo connection data to 
actually issue the commands slonik issues today.

So there are a number of callbacks in flyway. beforeMigration, etc, however
they all get executed inside a subtransaction, in other words before the
call back is executed the do begin; then the callback then end;

Yes, the complexity of this makes it difficult to generalize. For not it's
not in scope
