Subject: [Slony1-general] change password
Message-ID: <10925035.957191328189418573.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hi,
I?m using a Postgresql database version: 8.4 and I have some tables in replica 
between two servers with slony 2.0.6.
I need, for security issues, to change the password of the master database. Is 
there a way to change the password stored in the cluster without stopping the 
replica and start again from the beginning? 

Thank you

Francesco

Subject: [Slony1-general] What is the behavior of slony wait for event after
	lock set command.
Message-ID: <1328202815.77163.YahooMailNeo@web122511.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

We are trying  to do a swith over and it is taking a lot of time. 


We are following the following steps to perform switchover:
	1. Lock Set
	2. Wait for Event (timout = 300)
	3. Move Set (timeout = 300)
	4. Wait for Event (timout = 300)
The alt perl script we have with slony source has the following sequence:
	1. Lock Set
	2. Sync
	3. Wait for Event
	4. Move Set
What should be the correct sequence of event and how can I make switchover faster.

Regards

Sure, you can submit STORE PATH with the new password, and that will
propagate across the cluster.  (Likely several requests, one for each
communications path.)

It is considered better form to use a .pgpass file, so passwords are not
visible in slony configuration altogether.

You will also need to revise the configuration used to launch slon
processes.  Look for slon.conf in the documentation.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Slony 2.0.x and PostgreSQL 9.1
Message-ID: <4F2B3552.9000007@ca.afilias.info>

Those of you paying attention noticed that I just released 1.2.23 and 
2.1.1 but not 2.0.8

We had applied the fix for bug #255 the 'serialization conflicts with 
PostgreSQL 9.1' on the 2.0 branch in addition to the 2.1 branch.

When testing 2.0.8 RC2 I noticed that once in a while the disorder - 
"MoveSet" test in the clustertest framework gave me failures where the 
nodes could end up with different data.   The MoveSet test does 11 move 
sets between nodes in the cluster.  If I run the MoveSet test in a loop 
10 times I would typicaly get one failed test run.

On the version before the bug #255 commit I was never able to reproduce 
that failure on many runs.

I have also not been able to reproduce that failure on the 2.1.1 with 
which includes a fix for #255. (which is why I released 2.1.1)

(All of the above is with PostgreSQL 9.1).

My inclination is to take out the fix for #255 from 2.0.8 and also put 
back in the warning about 9.1 "might be unsupported" that you would see 
with 2.0.7.

We can also leave the bug #255 fix in and put the warning back.

If someone can figure out why this is failing in 2.0 then we do talk 
about addressing that.  I can't rule out it being a problem in the test 
itself, but nothing pops out at me  (A version of the disorder tests 
back-ported to 2.0 can be found at 
https://github.com/ssinger/slony1-engine/tree/REL_2_0_STABLE-clustertest)

Subject: [Slony1-general] Cascading replication using altperl scripts.
Message-ID: <CF3E1A49FFAA4204A0F503E17D390913@CMOTUM25PC>

Hello list:

My name is Efrain and this week I?ve been using Slony-I, with the help of the documentation I?ve been able to setup replication between 2 nodes using slonik scripts and also with altperl scripts. For me, using altperl scritps is more comfortable but now I?m stucked trying to set cascading replication. I have this in mind:

    A1 ?> B1 ?> B2

Meaning that A1 would be the master to B1 but also B1 would be master of B2. My slon_tools.conf looks like this:

add_node(node     => 1,
         host     => '192.168.1.231',
         dbname   => 'prueba',
         port     => 5432,
         user     => 'postgres',
         password => '1');

add_node(node     => 2,
         host     => '192.168.1.232',
         dbname   => 'prueba',
         port     => 5432,
         noforward => allow,
         user     => 'pgsql',
         password => '2');

add_node(node     => 3,
         parent   => 2,
         host     => '192.168.1.233',
         dbname   => 'prueba',
         port     => 5432,
         user     => 'pgsql',
         password => '3');

I understand that B1 shall be configured to accept forward but I don?t now how to do this.

Any help would be really appreciated.

Thank you.

Hello,

I'm working on a project where we are using pg_dump to get the data out of one database and then using psql to load it into another.  The second database is the master db in a Slony replication cluster.  However, no matter what options I specify in pg_dump the changes are not being replicated.  I've use a standard dump which uses COPY, a --inserts dump which uses insert into & a --insert-columns dump which adds column names to the insert into statements.  However, if I edit the data in pgAdmin III using the view option for the table, that change is replicated just fine.  What is the difference between editing the data that way in pgAdmin III and using psql to load a dump file?

Glyn,

My code is not creating the dump with --disable-triggers.  So far, I have only been able to get messages to replicate if I use the view option in pgAdmin III or ESRI's ArcCatalog to edit the data (it is GIS data stored with PostGIS types).

There are very few things it could be then. If it works in other 
situations, that means the Slony triggers are enabled and working 
on the tables, which rules out one possibility. Open the pg_dump 
output in a text editor and make sure it is using INSERTs, and that 
there is nothing funny at the top of the script (e.g. changing 
the session_replication_role or disabling triggers). Also, I'm 
assuming this is a --data-only pg_dump? Finally, make sure your are 
loading the output into the correct database and that no 
search_path/schema tweaks could be affecting things.

If all else fails, see if you can create a simple test case (e.g. 
pg_dump a single small table) and post it here.

Greg,

Due to performance reasons we are using a COPY command now (INSERT INTO was just for testing).  With some of our tables having 5 milling + records we want it to go as fast as.  You are correct in assuming it is a --data-only dump.  Before the first COPY statement the dump contains the following.

SET client_encoding = 'UTF8';
SET standard_conforming_strings = off;
SET check_function_bodies = false;
SET client_min_messages = warning;
SET escape_string_warning = off;
SET search_path = sde, pg_catalog;

I have had the data replicate correctly once when loading the data for a single table using COPY, but not since then.  I get the following statistics for the slave node.

Last event - 465
Last event timestamp - 2/17/2012 10:49:46
Last acknowledged - 56
Last ack timestamp - 2/17/2012 09:20:05
Last response time - 0.016 s
Outstand acks - 409
No ack for - 01:29:41.127
Hanging event - 57
Command - SYNC

Also, I'm not sure if it matters; but we are using two engines for one Slony-I service.  One for mostly static data and one for data that can change quite often.  Each engine has its own DB and the data that can change quite often is always replicating fine, but it is always edited using ESRI's Arc Map at some point in the process.

Well I cannot see any other obvious problems, so I would suggest 
seeing if you can get that single table COPY pg_dump to work 
again, then expand the scope (if working) or narrow the scope (if not).

Ah, that could certainly be a factor - can you explain the layout a bit 
more to the list?

Hi,

I'm trying to use the example in the 2.1.1 documentation but I keep getting
a syntax error.  I've noted that the doc shows 
cluster name = $CLUSTERNAME;
is a valid syntax but unless I change the $ to a @ I get a syntax error,
thus as I'm new and unsure I don't know if there are errors in the
documentation or something I am missing.  Never the less, my script as as
follows:


#!/bin/sh

Greg, I populated one table with 100000 bogus records and that worked fine.  If I add a second table it stops working.

The setup is as follows.  We use ESRI replication technology to get data from one ArcSDE instance into a PostgreSQL + PostGIS ArcSDE instance on our server.  We then do a data only pg_dump on that database and a psql load on our "live" database.  Slony is then supposed to replicate the data out to the "live" database on our other servers.  The problem is occurring on the last step :(

Trying to run the example slony config script in the documentation but
getting the following error:

Read in the doc that likely the lib is not in the correct place or $libdir
is not set correctly, but everything looks to be in place.  Am I missing
something else I am not aware of?

Hi,

We are currently using slony 2.1.1/postgresql 9.1.2.

We were wondering if it will be possible  in future versions of slony to
replicate
depending on the contents of some fields in a table record.
So in our current implemenation we have

table SomeTable ( name varchar, ......);

on the master. This table is succesfully replicated to several slaves
(slave1, slave2, ......).

What we would like is depending on the value of 'name', replicate the
record,
to e.g.

slave1 if (name like 'a%'),
slave2 if (name like 'b%),

etc...

Are there any thoughts for slony being capable of doing this ?
How can we help developing this ? Are there other replication solutions
that are capable of doing this ?

Thanks!

Ger Timmens

Just wondering if you could do this by partitioning first, and then
using Slony to replicate the partitions?

Has your query (mostly write) load changed?  Did one of your disks in
your array die?  You should poke around to see if you're saturating
either your network or one of the servers' disk I/O bandwidth.

Exactly what I was thinking.  Replicate the partitions as you need in
different sets to different destinations.

You might want to read up on slony bug #167.  If replication fall behind 
(for whatever reason) versions of slony prior to 2.1 can exhibit the 
behaviour your describing until they have caught up.

I've not forgotten about this, it just took me a while to get to it.

Even if I add that block back into confoptions.c  I am seeing some issues.

1) quit_sync_finalsync is an int, not an int64, most of our event 
sequence numbers exceed the space available for a 32 bit int.  We don't 
have  a SLON_C_INT64 array + processing code in confoptions.c, we would.

2) Even with a smaller quit sequence number slon is segfaulting in the 
call to slon_log(FATAL).  I am not sure why.

3) If slon didn't segfault I think it would keep restarting itself and 
exiting due to the slon_retry() call, I don't think this is what the 
user intends to happen.

Getting this feature working seems a bit more complicated than just 
adding in the confoption block.

Changes committed into master in the last week provide the
underpinnings to make it a lot easier to implement this sort of thing
in the future.

The format of log records have changed, so that instead of the log
table capturing literal portions of SQL statements, it captures an
array indicating the data.

This means that, in the next version of Slony, splitting apart the log
data to perform special logic based on the data no longer requires
parsing SQL, instead, data can be accessed more directly from the
array.

This isn't particularly well documented at this point, which is
something I probably ought to add to my ToDo list to rectify.

It's plausible that in a subsequent version of Slony, we'll introduce
some sort of "hook" to provide an intentional way of injecting the
sort of logic that you're talking about.

"Plausible" here means that since nobody has thought very hard about
it, nobody has arrived at any particularly elegant way to fit it in.
I'd think it desirable to NOT add a hook until there's an idea of how
to do it well.  Of course, once someone arrives at a reasonably
elegant way of describing the plumbing, it's entirely possible that
this would prove pretty easy to implement.

Some time ago I had to implement such thing. I did it by

- on Master and SlaveA, create "shadow table" SomeTablePartA , identical 
to SomeTable but holding only its well-defined subset.
- on Master, create triggers on SomeTable, to maintain the subset in 
SomeTablePartA
- add SomeTablePartA to replication set - so it is replicated like any 
other table to SlaveA
- on SlaveA database, create a trigger on SomeTablePartA (trigger active 
on slave - must be added to Slony config), which populated changes back 
to SomeTable on SlaveA.

I have tried to migrate from PostgreSQL 8.3 and its associated version of Slony to PostgreSQL 8.4 and Slony 2.0.4.  However, even following the directions at http://www.pgadmin.org/docs/dev/slony-example.html I cannot get any data to replicate, the slave node(s).  Everything appears to work great and according to the steps it should be working.  But the slave node(s) never get a Replication Set and the associated data in it.  Does anyone know of a tutorial similar to http://www.enterprisedb.com/resources-community/tutorials-quickstarts/all-platforms/how-setup-slony-i-replication-postgres-plus for Slony 2.0.4?

Nothing unusual there.

Well I cannot see any other obvious problems, so I would suggest seeing if you can get that single table COPY pg_dump to work again, then expand the scope (if working) or narrow the scope (if not).

Ah, that could certainly be a factor - can you explain the layout a bit more to the list?

Hi 

Nothing
 of that; but we had one of the slave down for last 8 days and still in

For sure. Your change log is really big, and thus slow to scan for new
changes.  You need to drop that node.

Also please keep replies on list.

Here is the issue..

Can I safely delete that event from sl_event with ev_type='DROP_NODE' ?

How far behind are your other nodes now?
Did the slow log selections due to the that node being behind for 8 days 
make your other nodes behind as well?

Do not manually delete events from sl_event I don't see that helping things.

Subject: [Slony1-general] New slave
Message-ID: <28401013.47991330011484193.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hi,
Currently I have a slony replica with one master and one slave. I need to have 
an additional slave on my system. 
I cannot stop the master to create a backup (it requires a lot of time), so my 
question is: is it possible with slony to populate the new slave database and 
sync it? 
With the single master slave I have till now, I started the cluster after 
populating the slave database with the same data of the master and it works 
fine. 

Please let me know.
Thank you,
Francesco

Well, when you populated the *first* slave database, that didn't
require any outage on the origin node, did it?

You simply need to:
a) Populate the new database with the *schema* from the master.  There
is no need to capture the data; Slony will delete the data anyways.
   "pg_dump -s" should do the job.
   You'll want to exclude the schema that Slony creates, or drop it
from the new database, if it got loaded
b) STORE NODE to indicate the new node
c) Start up slon for the new node
d) SUBSCRIBE SET against each set that you want on the new node

None of those steps involve an outage of the "master" database.

Yeah, can't think of what else it might be. Probably the only thing 
to do at this point, unless others on the list can think of things, 
is to edit one of the dumps to limit to a few rows, load it via 
psql, then check the slony tables (e.g. sl_log_1) to see if the 
triggers fired and how far it got. In other words, where is it 
breaking down? My guess is that the triggers are not populating 
the Slony tables for some reason, but there are other steps in which 
it could break down.

Greg,

I managed to get 2.0.4 running on PostgreSQL 8.4.  Using this setup the changes are replicating out.  It must have been something in Slony 1.x & PostgreSQL 8.3 that was the issue.

Hi

When I restarted slony, then all of a sudden my sl_status is empty and nothing is getting replicated in the subscriber (node 37) nor its forwarding.

All I can see in the logs...

finally it dies with dup error..

Any help on how to fix this will be appreciated.. other nodes are fine in the cluster.

How long have you waited to see if slony cleans up all by itself? I've
seen it take several hours some times.

 replication stops right after start
Message-ID: <CADEyix0+n_Rr=KxArFqcoo0DsWYWJnnT5=z+2duTsLNgk+D+7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been trying to set up a small Slony cluster (only 2 nodes) for
the last 2 days but I can't get it to work. Everytime I get the same
result: The replication starts of fine. Slony start copying, trying to
get all the tables in the subscribing node up to speed. But somewhere
along the way the 2nd node stops getting updates. Slony replicates all
the data in a specific table up to a specific point in time and then
no more. And this time seems to coincide with when the copying of data
for that specific table started.

An example to illustrate the scenario:

Let's say I have set up the whole replication system and then at 12:00
I start the actual replication. Around 12:05 copying of table A from
node 1 to node 2 starts. It finishes but only the data that was
received before  12:05 get copied to node 2. Then at 12:10 copying of
table B starts. Same thing here: Slony copies all the data that was
received before 12:10 to node 2. And this is the same for all tables.

The logs for the slon deamons show:

Subject: [Slony1-general] Slony replication stops right after start
Message-ID: <CADEyix3zDdd-GrDEz0GXGTR0-J1_G3OJfNC1CbSn3kqyLD3idw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been trying to set up a small Slony cluster (only 2 nodes) for
the last 2 days but I can't get it to work. Everytime I get the same
result: The replication starts of fine. Slony start copying, trying to
get all the tables in the subscribing node up to speed. But somewhere
along the way the 2nd node stops getting updates. Slony replicates all
the data in a specific table up to a specific point in time and then
no more. And this time seems to coincide with when the copying of data
for that specific table started.

An example to illustrate the scenario:

Let's say I have set up the whole replication system and then at 12:00
I start the actual replication. Around 12:05 copying of table A from
node 1 to node 2 starts. It finishes but only the data that was
received before  12:05 get copied to node 2. Then at 12:10 copying of
table B starts. Same thing here: Slony copies all the data that was
received before 12:10 to node 2. And this is the same for all tables.

The logs for the slon deamons show:

Origin node:

You didn't say what version of slony you are using with which version of 
postgresql.

I don't see anything in the logs you posted about the slon for the 
origin node generating sync events.  At DEBUG2 or higher (at least ons 
some versions of slony) you should be getting "syncThread: new 
sl_action_seq %s " type messages in the log for the slon origin.

Are new SYNC events being generated in the origin sl_event table with 
ev_origin=$originid?

Many versions of slony require an exclusive lock on sl_event to generate 
sync events.  Do you have something preventing this?  (ie look in 
pg_locks to see if the slony sync connection is waiting on a lock).

Hi,

Sorry, seems I forgot to post versions:

Slony: 2.0.7
PostgreSQL:  9.0.5

I restarted the slon deamon with debug=4 on both nodes and this is what I got:

New SYNC events are being generated. I can find several rows in the
origin's sl_event table with ev_origin=$originid. None of them however
(including rows with ev_origin=$subscribedid) are older than about 15
minutes, even though the most recent data in the subscriber db is
several hours old.

I'm not really sure how to interpret the data in the pg_locks view,
but none of them (neither origin or subscriber) have any rows where
the "granted" column isn't set to TRUE, if that means anything?

This shows that SYNC events are now being generated on the origin.

This shows that SYNC events are being processed on the slave and there 
is nothing to do.  I also notice that you have 8 replication sets.  Are 
changes not being replicated to all tables in all the sets or only some 
of the sets?

sl_log_1 and sl_log_2 on the origin should have a record of rows that 
need to be replicated.  If you insert a row into one of your tables you 
should then see that data in sl_log_1 or sl_log_2.  Is this the case.

Hi,

None of the tables in any of the sets are being replicated (there are
9 of them in total by the way). The most recent data in all of them is
from within half an hour of each other.

The s_log_1 and s_log_2 tables on the provider node are currently
holding around 10k rows between the two of them. Nothing older that
1,5 hours. Does this mean that Slony thinks everything older than that
has already been replicated?

I don't know if it matters but maybe I should mention that the two
machines in the cluster were previously in a cluster where the roles
were reversed, i.e. the subscriber used to be the provider and vice
versa. After a system failure and a subsequent failover I cleaned the
whole cluster (drop node and uninstall node) before attempting to set
it up again. I can't help to think that there maybe some lingering
configurations that are getting in the way?
