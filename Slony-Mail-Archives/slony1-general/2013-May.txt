Can you post the logs for both PostgreSQL and the slon daemons?

Message-ID: <CAAvPandy92VNFPPax7_44N5WnKuJUhob+eW-DdsRAde_VPQ=gA@mail.gmail.com>

I am using slony for replicating my pgsql database. I want to propagate the
database schema changes(DDL) from master to the slave machine with the help
of slonik execute script. I am curious to know what happens when I run
slonik execute script(on master) and slave machine is not reachable. How
will these schema changes get reflected on slave machine?

I'm pretty sure slonik will just block until it is reachable. Try not to do
that. This may be different in slony 2.0+, but I haven't tested.

Unless there is an implicit or explicit WAIT FOR EVENT done my slonik,
nothing should block. EXECUTE SCRIPT in all versions prior to 2.2
creates an event, containing the SQL. In 2.2 the SQL is injected into
the data stream processed during SYNC application to make it work
reliable with concurrent table access.

This sounds very much like lost TCP connections that never get the FIN
or RST packts. Have you tried to enable keepalive with settings, that
let connections time out within 5 minutes or faster in both, the
PostgreSQL and the Slony configurations?

Subject: [Slony1-general] Error while adding new set through altperl slonik
	script
Message-ID: <CAAPsc-SyR+WtBpxN_8RLT1-Hp53-KicX6S_4dsENEbN1tUJEgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have configured Slony-II using altperl tools. I am trying to add a new
table to a running replication using following steps:

1.
 ./slonik_execute_script --config slon_tools.conf 1
/usr/pgsql-9.2/bin/test.sql | ./slonik             (sql file has only
create table command)
<stdin>:4: NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index
"ddl_slony_pkey" for table "ddl_slony"

2.
Adding the table in the slon_tools.conf file as set2 below set1:

 "set2" => {
       "set_id"       => 2,
       "table_id"     => 2,
       "sequence_id"  => 2,
       "pkeyedtables" => ["public.ddl_slony"],
       "keyedtables"  => {},
       "sequences"    => [],
    },

3. While executing create set, I am getting the following error:

 ./slonik_create_set -c slon_tools.conf 2 | ./slonik

<stdin>:11: Subscription set 2 created
<stdin>:12: Adding tables to the subscription set
<stdin>:13: PGRES_FATAL_ERROR lock table

'public.ddl_slony', 'ddl_slony_pkey', 'Table public.ddl_slony with primary
key');  - ERROR:  Slony-I: setAddTable_int: table id 2 has already been
assigned!
CONTEXT:  SQL statement "SELECT "_ms_prod_slony".setAddTable_int(p_set_id,

PL/pgSQL function
_ms_prod_slony.setaddtable(integer,integer,text,name,text) line 28 at
PERFORM

I tried the above by manually creating another table on both nodes and
adding and creating set as set3. Still facing the same issue.

Can anybody point out where I am going wrong and how it should be fixed?

Thanks,
GB

Hi Stephane,

Thank you for your response.

There are 61 tables in set1. I had added table id as 2 in set 2. Now I
changed it 62 and ran the slonik_create_set successfully.

Warm regards,
GB

Subject: [Slony1-general] Truncate trigger in slony 2.1.x+ requires
	superuser?
Message-ID: <5193CB24.20404@consistentstate.com>

Hi All,

I have a slony cluster running on slony 2.1.0 (Have tested this 
situation on 2.1.3 also). This cluster is replicating a drupal database, 
which preforms truncates on some of the cache tables periodically. When 
the truncates execute, they fire the log_truncate trigger in slony, 
which immediatly errors due to no select permissions on the sl_table 
relation in the slony cluster.

In normal events (inserts, updates, deletes), the user doesn't need any 
permissions granted in the slony schema in order for the event trigger 
to log the event into sl_log_1, etc.

So is this a design decision, making truncates on slony tables only be 
able to be executed by superusers in the database?

I've got it working in a testing environment by granting the following:
grant select on _slony.sl_table to user;
grant insert on _slony.sl_log_status to user;
grant insert on _slony.sl_log_1 to user;
grant insert on _slony.sl_log_2 to user;
grant usage on _slony.sl_action_seq to user;

However I don't like the idea of either A. granting these permissions to 
slony tables or B. making my drupal user a 'superuser' to get around it. 
Are those my only two options here to allow truncates to work?

Thanks,
- Brian F

I would call it a bug. The truncate trigger should be "security 
definer", like the log trigger and several other functions are.

I have committed the 2-line fix for this to master and REL_2_1_STABLE.

The diff for 2.1 is attached.
