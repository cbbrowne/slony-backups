Can you post the logs for both PostgreSQL and the slon daemons?

Subject: [Slony1-general] pgsql replication with database schema changes
	using slonik execute script
Message-ID: <CAAvPandy92VNFPPax7_44N5WnKuJUhob+eW-DdsRAde_VPQ=gA@mail.gmail.com>

I am using slony for replicating my pgsql database. I want to propagate the
database schema changes(DDL) from master to the slave machine with the help
of slonik execute script. I am curious to know what happens when I run
slonik execute script(on master) and slave machine is not reachable. How
will these schema changes get reflected on slave machine?
