Subject: [Slony1-general]  Verifying Data Consistency with Slony?
Message-ID: <31787795.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello and thanks for taking the time to read my post...

I'm using Slony-I v1.2.20 and I have a simple master/slave replication
occurring between two servers.  Recently, we had a bit of an interruption to
our network and I need to verify the consistency of the data between the two
databases. I've checked the logs for any outstanding errors, but they seem
to report that everything is running fine.  

Aside form using sql queries, is there any way to check data consistency
using slony (ie ensure that the tables are in fact replicated 1:1)?

Thanks for your help in advance!

Cheers,
Jason

No.  If you don't trust slony's own report that replication is
up-to-date, then you have to run queries on the DB.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Lock set doesn't generate event in 2.0.6?
Message-ID: <331907.4657.qm@web26002.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi Guys,

Last week we upgraded from 1.2.22 to 2.0.6 and today I'm trying to move a set from one node to another.? I'm using my own set of scripts that I've been using for years with 1.2.22, however when I wait for event after lock set I get the message "Error: script did not generate any event on node 1"


Below is the script I'm running:

??????? ECHO 'ATTEMPT: Lock the set and wait for the lock:';
??????? LOCK SET ( ID = 1, ORIGIN = 1);
??????? ECHO 'ATTEMPT: Waiting for confirm on all nodes:';
??????? WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN = 1, CONFIRMED = ALL, WAIT ON = 1, TIMEOUT = 0);

I know we now can't run wait for event in a try block, but what's changed and what am I doing wrong here?


Thanks
Glyn

lock set does not generate an event in either 1.2.22 or 2.0.6

What has changed between them is that if you 'wait for event' in 1.2 
when no event then the 'wait for event' command is treated like a no-op, 
it continues without waiting.  In 2.0 the 'wait for event' command 
generates an error if you try to wait for an event that does not exist.

Ah, okay.? So there's no need to wait for event after lock set and before running move set then? 

I'm pretty sure that was the way I was advised (or read somewhere) to run move set back in the day.

Looking at the function I see it's going to have done its work by the time it returns anyway.

No there is no need to do a 'wait for event' after a LOCK SET.

I don't remember *ever* doing a wait for event after a lock set.  it
just waits until the lock is complete.

Subject: [Slony1-general] 2.0.6 Subscribe set errors
Message-ID: <165449.30644.qm@web26004.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi Guys,

Just had an issue with subscribe set in 2.0.6.? From what I can see somehow slonik is passing parameters 
to reshapesubscription in the wrong order, instead of (sub_set, sub_provider, sub_receiver) it seems to be 
sending (sub_provider, sub_set, sub_receiver).? In turn that made slonik hang on me and borked my subscriptions. 

Here's what I submitted to slonik:

??? SUBSCRIBE SET ( ID = 1000, PROVIDER = 4, RECEIVER = 5, FORWARD = YES );

Here's the error message I get from slonik:

??? Way5b:/pgsql/slony# slonik reshape.scr
??? reshape.scr:17: ATTEMPT:? SUBSCRIBE SET
??? reshape.scr:18: NOTICE:? subscribe set: omit_copy=f
??? reshape.scr:18: NOTICE:? subscribe set: omit_copy=f
??? CONTEXT:? SQL statement "SELECT? "_main_replication".subscribeSet_int( $1 ,? $2 ,? $3 ,? $4 ,? $5 )"

??? PL/pgSQL function "reshapesubscription" line 11 at SQL statement
??? error reshaping subscriber

And here's what my reshapesubscription looks like:

??? CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION _main_replication.reshapesubscription(integer, integer, integer)
??? ? RETURNS integer AS
??? $BODY$
??? declare
??? ??? p_sub_set??? ??? ??? alias for $1;
??? ??? p_sub_provider??? ??? alias for $2;
??? ??? p_sub_receiver??? ??? alias for $3;
??? begin
??? ??? -- ----
??? ??? -- Grab the central configuration lock
??? ??? -- ----
??? ??? lock table "_main_replication".sl_config_lock;
??? 
??? ??? update "_main_replication".sl_subscribe set sub_provider=p_sub_provider
??? ??? ??? ?? WHERE sub_set=p_sub_set AND sub_receiver=p_sub_receiver;
??? ??? if found then
??? ??? ?? perform "_main_replication".RebuildListenEntries();
??? ??? ?? notify "_main_replication_Restart";
??? ??? end if;
??? ??? return 0;
??? end
??? $BODY$
??? LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE;

Looking in the slonik.c starting on on line 3541 I can see the following:

??????????????? slon_mkquery(&query,
???????????????????????????????????????? "select \"_%s\".reshapeSubscription(%d,%d,%d);",
???????????????????????????????????????? stmt->hdr.script->clustername,
???????????????????????????????????????? stmt->sub_provider,stmt->sub_setid,
???????????????????????????????????????? stmt->sub_receiver);

Unless I'm going crazy (It is now 4am), that pretty much looks the wrong way around to me?

Thanks
Glyn

After discussion with Chris and Steve I have committed this change to 
2.0 STABLE as well as master (current 2.1 BETA). It seems safe enough.

Greg's suggestion to just look for three numbers in the string involves 
a bit more dramatic changes because that may require moving from 
sscanf() to using regular expressions. A change we should consider for 
2.2, but definitely nothing we want to back patch into 2.0.

Yes the parameters appear to be passed in the wrong order.

I have created a bug for this and attached a patch
http://bugs.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=220

Once Jan or Chris looks over the patch I will commit this for 2.0.7 and 
for the next 2.1 beta

Thanks for the report

Thanks Steve, I applied the change shortly after emailing the list last night/this morning and can confirm it appears to resolve the issue.

Hi to all,
i have a question for you about subscribe problem.I try to explain ho work my 
database cluster.
I have a database with 10 tables with IP:192.168.25.86 (this is the matser) 
and another database with only three tables with IP:192.168.25.89 (slave).
My goal is to replicate only the three tables of the master.So the tables in 
the slave have the same data that are inide the master database ( i used pg_dum 
and pg_restore command with only data option).
I create a cluster script into the server of master database and i run it. No 
problem!
I start slon process in both server and i specified the same cluster name. No 
problem!
After i create a subscribe script into master database and i run it. Problem:

CONTEXT:  SQL statement "SELECT  "_sql_master_slave".subscribeSet_int( $1 ,  
$2 ,  $3 , 
$4 ,  $5 )"
    PL/pgSQL function "subscribeset" line 77 at PERFORM

What does it means?
i have to run subscribe script from slave server?
Please help me. I use slony version 1-2.0.6.

Slony normally prints this notice out as part of the subscription 
process. It is normal and does not indicate an error.

As a general rule, if the notification doesn't have the word "ERROR"
in it, then it isn't actually an error.

Slony reports various things that it does, so that an observing
administrator has some visibility of what it's up to.  In a number of
places, we RAISE NOTICE to indicate what's up.

Sometimes PostgreSQL automatically generates notices.  For instance,
if you create a table, and define a primary key, a notice will be
generated indicating extra actions taken.  For instance:

emp at localhost->  create table foo (id serial primary key);
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create implicit sequence "foo_id_seq" for
serial column "foo.id"
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index
"foo_pkey" for table "foo"
CREATE TABLE

It should be clear that those aren't errors.  When Slony generates
notices, they're not errors, either.

I think something is missing in the context information that was
reported; the information shown is neither an error message nor
notification of something that was done, but rather is merely
indicating where the thread of execution was when something else,
which presumably was output immediately before the CONTEXT line, was
reported.  I'd sure like to see what was reported BEFORE the
"CONTEXT:" line.

There has been some debugging code that wasn't very useful that has
gotten into the code base.  I don't always feel badly about that - it
can be useful to get that extra bit of output.  But there may be a
"RAISE NOTICE" statement that we could want to trim out.

Message-ID: <1308804746.2065.3.camel@scadmin-ThinkPad-T61>

Hi all

I set up slony to replicate 3 tables from one opensuse pc (master node)
to another opensuse pc (slave node). It works well at first. After
running for few days, it suddenly come out the error message of -

ERROR: Slony-I: Table euprofiles is replicated and cannot be modified on
a subscriber node - role=0

euprofiles is one of the tables being replicated by slony.

I know that this message may occur if you are trying to write to the
table of slave node. But here I am writing to master node only.

Does anyone see similar problem?


Best regards
Rodney Wang

Could you execute \d euprofiles on every node and give us the result?

Do you have any message in slony logfile?

For some reason, it now thinks the table is on the slave.
How do you connect to your databases ? Direct connection? Through a virtual IP?

Is there any auto-magical switch in your infrastructure?

Hi,

I connect to the both master and slave nodes directly.

I already re-configure slony, and it is working properly now

for master node , the triggers are:
<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indexes:
    "euprofiles_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
Triggers:
    _profile_propagation_logtrigger AFTER INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE ON
euprofiles FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE
_profile_propagation.logtrigger('_profile_propagation', '2', 'k')

Disabled triggers:
    _profile_propagation_denyaccess BEFORE INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE ON
euprofiles FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE
_profile_propagation.denyaccess('_profile_propagation')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


for slave node, the triggers are:
<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indexes:
    "euprofiles_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
Triggers:
    _profile_propagation_denyaccess BEFORE INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE ON
euprofiles FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE
_profile_propagation.denyaccess('_profile_propagation')
Disabled triggers:
    _profile_propagation_logtrigger AFTER INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE ON
euprofiles FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE
_profile_propagation.logtrigger('_profile_propagation', '2', 'k')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

I don't know how to reproduce the problem, just waiting it to happen
again. To give more information about how I setup slony, Following is my
scripts I used to configure slony

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##
## Subscribe
##

subscribe(){

provider=$1
subscriber=$2
if test ${provider} -eq ${subscriber}
then
        echo "provider and subscriber should be different"
        return
fi


/export/home/tools/pgsql/current/bin/slonik <<EOF
include <preamble.sk>;
echo 'Subscribing ${subscriber} to ${provider}';
subscribe set (id=1,provider=$provider,receiver=$subscriber,forward=no);
sync(id=1);
wait for event (origin=$provider, confirmed=$subscriber, wait on=1);
echo 'Done';
EOF


}


##
## Add new node 
##

addnode() {

new_node_id=$1
new_node_comment=$2
new_node_conn=$3

/export/home/tools/pgsql/current/bin/slonik <<EOF
include <preamble.sk>;
echo 'Adding new node ${new_node_id} ${new_node_comment}
${new_node_conn}';
store node(id=${new_node_id}, comment='${new_node_comment}', event
node=1);
store path(server=1, client=${new_node_id}, conninfo='host=168.198.1.92
port=5432 dbname=ops_db user=scadmin password=scadmin0');
store path(server=${new_node_id}, client=1,
conninfo='${new_node_conn}');
echo 'done';
EOF


}


##
## initialize slony cluster 
##

initcluster() {

/export/home/tools/pgsql/current/bin/slonik <<EOF
include <preamble.sk>;
echo 'initializing cluster';
init cluster (id=1, comment='navigator');
create set (id=1, origin=1, comment='source tables');
set add table(set id=1, origin=1, id=1, fully qualified
name='public.code_descs', comment='source table #1',
key='code_descs_pkey');
set add table(set id=1, origin=1, id=2, fully qualified
name='public.euprofiles', comment='source table #2',
key='euprofiles_pkey');
set add table(set id=1, origin=1, id=3, fully qualified
name='public.glob_confs', comment='source table #2',
key='glob_confs_pkey');
EOF

}


##
## Dispatch command
##

if [[ $1 = "sub" ]]; then
        if [[ $# -lt 3 ]]; then
                echo "usage: $0 sub <provider node id> <subscriber node
id> ";
                exit 0;
        fi
        subscribe $2 $3;

elif [[ $1 = "add" ]]; then
        if [[ $# -lt 4 ]]; then
                echo "usage: $0 add <new node id> <new node comment>
<new node connection>";
                exit 0;
        fi
        addnode $2 "$3" "$4";
elif [[ $1 = "init" ]]; then
        initcluster
else
        echo "command not valid, usage: $0 < init | sub | add >";
fi
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

I run the the following two commands on master side

> ./slony_admin.sh init
> ./slony_admin.sh add 2 iabox "host=168.198.1.46 port=5432
dbname=igops.ia.db user=scadmin password=scadmin0"

and the following one commnds on the slave node
> ./slony_admin.sh sub 1 2

That's all what I did.



Thanks
Rodney

These scripts seem OK.
I would guess something has reenabled the disabled triggers. But what?

Is there any case that slony will turn a master node into a slave node
automatically?

None that I'm aware of.
There's no such automatic procedure.

Hi to all,
i have a question for you. I'n using slony to replicate two databases.
I run cluster script, after:

/usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin/slon sql_cluster_master_slave  "dbname=master 
user=navmap" > slonmaster.log &
/usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin/slon sql_cluster_master_slave "dbname=slave 
user=navmap" > slonslave.log &

at the end subscribe script.

My question is:

the two log file grow up in size day by day. I like to clean up these files 
and rebuild from scratch.
Is there a slony command to do that or i have to create a script and run it 
from crontab that delete these files?

Thanks


Francesco

I actually let syslog deal with it... something like this

/usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin/slon sql_cluster_master_slave  "dbname=master
user=navmap"| logger -t slony1

Syslog's logs are rotated automatically by logrotate.
You might want to set up a filter for "slony1" to stop slony cluttering 
up the main log file.

logrotate will do the trick.

I use syslog (configured through slon configuration file) and configured
logrotation through a file located in logrotate.d, which contains :

/var/log/slony/*.log {
  weekly
  rotate 2
  copytruncate
  delaycompress
  compress
  notifempty
  missingok
}

logrotate is usually issued by cron. So you don't have anything special to do.
The configuration I gave was for a weekly rotate, if your files are overgrowing
on a daily basis, you can have

daily
rotate 7

for instance.

Subject: [Slony1-general] How is replication of TRIGGERS handled under Slony?
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=jBrfR0pMC5+HUeym6JDRzTTz87w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.  I've been using Slony for a couple of years, and it's been working great;
but we've just started using triggers in our application, and when I manually
added the trigger on the subscriber side, next time I tried to recreate the
data set, it wouldn't go due to multiple triggers issue.  So how do I replicate
triggers, please?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the issue I ran into after manually adding the trigger on the
subscriber:


NOTICE: Slony-I: alterTableForReplication(): multiple instances of
trigger % on table %'',

This normally happens if you have a table that had a trigger attached
to it that replication hid due to this being a subscriber node, and
then you added a trigger by the same name back to replication. Now,
when trying to "fix up" triggers, those two triggers conflict.

The DDL script will keep running and rerunning, or the UNINSTALL NODE
will keep failing, until you drop the "visible" trigger, by hand, much
as you must have added it, by hand, earlier.

ERROR: Slony-I: Unable to disable triggers

This is the error that follows the "multiple triggers" problem.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should I have added the trigger to replication using slonik?  If so,
how, please?  I looked
on the slony.info web site but did not find the answer.

I am using slony1-1.2.21

Thanks,
Aleksey

Hi.  In the Slony FAQ, section "5.2.8.4. Replication Fails - Unique
Constraint Violation" is listed under "hopefully obsolete".

I've just run into this issue, using Slony-I 1.2.21, running against
Postgres 8.4.8.  So looks like this issue is still around.

I had Slony repeatedly trying to insert values on the subscriber that
were rejected with "unique constraint violation".

Same values do not appear on the master -- I guess the master's
database rejected them.  It appears that Slony was attempting to
replicate to the subscriber a transaction that was rejected on the
master?  The description in 5.2.8.4 fits to a "t".  Looks like this
"glitch" is still around.

I've found the documentation of how SlonyI-1.2 handles triggers,
at http://slony.info/documentation/1.2/triggers.html, but I still don't
understand what I actually need to do to set up replication
if I have triggers on the master?

Could somebody please contribute a short procedural (howto)
section for this case?

Thanks,

Not sure exactly what you ran into, but I've never used Slony to
replicate DDL. It's also a bit weird that the name of the trigger
didn't get filled in. I usually define the triggers in the schema
before starting the replication.

One thing to realise is that by default triggers are not fired on
slaves. This is usually what you want, but if you're using triggers to
fire off some external process that you also want to happen on the
slave, you can use ALTER TABLE foo ENABLE ALWAYS TRIGGER bar;

What do you mean by "manually added"? Unless you used slony, I don't
see how slony could complain?

Have a nice day,

Did you attempt to add the trigger (or make any other DDL change) on the 
subscriber outside of an EXECUTE SCRIPT block?

In 1.2.x slony munges the catalog (pg_class) to disable triggers on the 
subscriber nodes.

The comments another poster gave you about ENABLE/DISALBE triggers 
applies  to Slony 2.0 but might not work as you want for 1.2

My understanding of a procedure for running triggers on the master with 
1.2 is that you

1. You write a SQL script that adds the triggers to the tables via 
EXECUTE SCRIPT.
2.  That script will then run on all nodes.
3.  When you insert data into your table your trigger will run along 
with the slony triggers.
4.  When slony replicates the data to the slave this trigger will NOT 
run (and nor will the slony trigger) becaues pg_class on the slave was 
munged by slony to prevent triggers from running.

If you want your trigger to also run on the slave you can accomplish 
this in 1.2 with the SET ADD TRIGGER command.

If you tried to add a trigger to a slave without using EXECUTE SCRIPT 
(in 1.2) you might have corrupted your slave.

This is all different in 2.0,  I would recommend also looking at how 2.0 
  deals with this stuff and start planning an upgrade.

Hi

I'm trying to setup slony to replicate table from one master to around
200 slaves. Can slony support slave number at this scale? It is observed
in pgadmin that when I have 1 slave, the num of listener is 1. However,
when I have 2 slaves, the num of listener increase from 1 to 4 (not 2).
Will this be a problem if the slave go to a large number, like 100?

Yes, you usually don't go over 12 or 15 nodes with Slony.

Running 200 slaves isn't a common use case for slony.
That doesn't mean it won't work.  I know of at least one person who is 
doing about 50 slaves, but I don't have details on the setup.

If your going to try Slony with 200 slaves this would be my advice

* Expect to encounter issues along the way, you will need to figure out 
the best way to deploy and tune things

* Slony supports the idea of cascaded subscribers.   You can have node 
something like

     1
     |

so you can have a number of direct subscribers then feeding a number of 
slaves.   Creating a layered network would probably work better than 
having 50 or 100 subscribers off a single node.

* Slony also supports something called 'log shipping' where the slon on 
a slave generates .sql files that can then be applied to other nodes 
downstream.  Since these other nodes are not technically part of the 
slony cluster (they don't have paths, or slon daemons) you can 
distribute the .sql files to as many machines as you want.  This might 
work for you

* In a slony cluster each node must confirm SYNC messages from EVERY 
other node even when a direct path between them doesn't exist (this 
explains  for the number of listeners you see in pgadmin).  At a 100 
nodes there will be a lot of SYNC/confirm messages.  You will probably 
have to increase the SYNC interval so you have fewer syncs going on.


* If you try any of this let us know what works or doesn't

As others have observed, no. Even cascading to that number may 
be a challenge. You might want to step back and ask if you really 
need that many slaves. Things like pgbouncer can help you scale 
vertically and reduce the number of slaves (horizontal scaling) 
you need.

I will try the log shipping and let you know.

Thanks

After reading the log shipping document from
http://slony.info/documentation/logshipping.html, find it not
straightforward to configure. I'll just give up on this solution.

Thanks.

Hi people.

I have 52 nodes in a slony installation. I'll give you more information.

First, I have few writes on that database, about 1 TPS, on the other hand,
I've done some 20K rows updates and I've got a lag of 20 minutes. The
database size is less than 10GB.

This is a very simple database, only 3 tables and only 2 really importants.
We implemented what Steve said, a cascade structure: one "forward-only"
database on each DC, then it forwards to the real slaves or for others
"forward-only" databases, something like this:

MASTER
|
` DC1
|  ` slave
|  ...
` DC2
|  ` slave
|  ...
` DC3
|  ` slave
   ...

Other rule that we implemented: no more than 8 nodes on each forward-only
node, so, we have 3 or 4 tree depth to real slaves.

We didn't measure too much how much bandwitch we use, because we know that
we have light database traffic, but it's very important to check that.
