I'd like to see us aim for a 2.2 release maybe next week that includes 
fixes for bug 356,354  and also removes the 'unsupported warning' for 
9.4. Bugs 338 and 345 are already committed on the 2.2 branch and would 
be included as well.

A few weeks ago I said I wanted to do a release close to the end of the 
year but that didn't happen. I make no promises with the above, other 
people might have other ideas.

If the patch (suitable for 2.2) for bug 350 is ready in the next few 
days I'd say we should include it.  Otherwise maybe we want to clarify 
the upgrade documentation to better describe the existing behaviour.

Thanks for the information.

What other stakeholders are involved, and do you have any ideas about
how they might weigh in?

350 is well above my experience level to fix, but I'd be happy to
document the issue if that's what's needed.

Cheers,
David.

I still haven't gotten a reply to my review request from Jan or Chris on 
those patches.  Also a decision on what todo about bug 350 (see below)

Other than that it involves me actually having the time to package up a 
candidate tar and run tests against various PG versions (mostly 
automated) and to manually test that I can still build against windows 
(not automated).

Any new problems that come up during the above could delay things.

I thought Rose had sent a patch in for this that needed to be tested, 
but I don't see the patch attached to the bug.

The issue here is that the instructions for upgrading to 2.2 say change 
cleanup interval to a few seconds  (
http://www.slony.info/documentation/2.2.2/slonyupgrade.html#AEN2512 )
This doesn't actually work as advertised.

If we aren't going to make cleanup_interval do what something useful 
then we need to provide upgrade instructions work as described. Manually 
forcing a log switch by calling the stored function might be one option.
