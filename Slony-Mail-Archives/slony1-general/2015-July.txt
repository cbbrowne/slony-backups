Subject: [Slony1-general] Cloning an origin?
Message-ID: <20150725043144.GA16677@fetter.org>

Folks,

While in the best of all possible worlds, we'd have planned out a
replication strategy before we get tables whose initial sync via
"SUBSCRIBE SET" will never finish, we aren't always given that much
ability to plan that soon.

CLONE is great when you want to light an Nth node for N > 2, but
that's just adjusting an extant cluster, not creating one in the first
place.

What stands between the state of the slony code and being able to
clone an origin node?

Cheers,
David.
