Subject: [Slony1-general] Events being duplicated in log shipping
Message-ID: <CAKWMdJYNm0y2mkr6EapQZJnHGqgrrq5JaAiTUiJFGJAYNP4EEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm experiencing some issues with slony log shipping where some events are
being written twice into log files.  Occasionally, what will happen is that
the replay of logship files generated by the -a flag, I will encounter
duplicate key violations in the destination node.  When I log in to look,
most (and in some cases, all) commands executed in the offending logship
file have already been applied to the destination node.  This leads me to
believe 1) the archive counter is not incrementing or 2) the DML commands
are being written more than once into separate logship files.

Has anyone else experienced this issue?  I'm running v. 2.1.3 on postgres
8.4.17

Regards,
--Richard

This sounds vaguely familiar, I think someone else has reported this 
before.  Do you have samples of .sql files that have the same data?

Is it the entire SYNC that is duplicated or only some rows?

What does your cluster configuration look like? Only 1 set and 1 
provider or something more complicated?

So in debian (or at least with Wheezy) where the original bug 315 was 
reported


libpq-dev puts port.h in /usr/include/postgresql/port.h so it gets 
picked up by the client include paths.  I am able to do a build with 
--with-pgport

This isn't actually a problem on debian, is the problem on OSX that 
port.h isn't being put in the libpq header directories?  Should it? 
Where do other platforms/distributions put port.h ?

Folks,

Would anyone concerned like to try pull requests as a way to try
things out from non-core developers like myself?  I've been working on
a few things in the altperl tools, and may wind into other parts of
the system.

By the way, would there be a lot of objections to making a
slon_tools.json as an alternative to slon_tools.conf, which is a chunk
of Perl code?

Cheers,
David.

We've received and merged pull requests in the past.  Sometimes we have 
exchanged github pull requests as a way of exchanging patches on WIP 
branches.

Slony doesn't have a github presence, but the core developers all have 
the slony1-engine repository cloned under our accounts.   A pull request 
isn't going to be rejected on the basis of it being a pull request, but 
there is a risk of it being forgotten about.

The time consuming part (for me) is actually testing the patches, 
particularly with the altperl stuff.

My vote would be to only support one config file format so if we moved 
to JSON we should drop support for the perl based .conf but provide a 
converter.  Dropping support for the old .conf format might raise more 
objections.
