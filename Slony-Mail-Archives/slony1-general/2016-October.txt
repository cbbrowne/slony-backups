Subject: [Slony1-general] Installation error - 'SerializableSnapshot

Message-ID: <CY4PR18MB09521FEB05EF23B432EFE3B998C20@CY4PR18MB0952.namprd18.prod.outlook.com>

I am attempting to build Slony 1.2.0 on a 64-bit machine running CentOS 7 and Postgresql 9.2.15.

Running the configure portion appears to work fine, as far as I can tell.  However, when I attempt to run the gmake all step, I get the block of errors below.

[####@#### slony1-1.2.0]# gmake all

I've tried to look that message up, but everything I've seen online seems to indicate that I'm missing some set of postgresql library files.   I've verified, to the best of my ability, that I've got the same packages installed on this machine as on a previous one where slony is running properly.  (The other, working machine is also running 64-bit CentOS.)

The postgresql packages I have installed on this machine are, as shown in 'yum list installed':
postgresql.x86_64                     9.2.15-1.el7_2                  @updates

Please, help me to determine what I'm missing, whether it's some uninstalled package, or whether it's something completely different that I simply can't see.

I don't think 1.2 series (even 1.2.23) can be compiled against PostgreSQL 9.2.
I know that 2.1.X works, so I'd suggest you to try with 2.1.4. I did not test
2.2 against PostgreSQL 9.2.

Subject: [Slony1-general] switchover between primary and secondary slave.
	question + masternode
Message-ID: <CAEaSS0a=d8pLYLrwcd5csM6BfvKBaRGo6KpsxaK+_B3MfU4LjA@mail.gmail.com>

I currently have a setup like this

Node:
1  primary
2  secondary
3 query
4 query
5 query
11 secondary
12 secondary
13 query
14 query
15 query

Replication is like this

Masternode=1

1 -> 2
2 -> 11 3 4 5
11 -> 12
12 -> 13 14 15

I'm going to switchover between 1 and 11

So switchover would mean node 1 becomes secondary and node 11 becomes
primary.  However as noted above currently 2 is talking to 11, 1 is not
replicating directly to 11 as 2 is doing the wide area replication to 11..

So do I have to subscribe 11 to node 1 prior to trying this switchover? How
is switchover handled if I don't , since data in 2 could not be 100% up to
date (1000ms delay) when the command is triggered, so 1 would have to
finish it's replication to 2 and 2 to 11, before 1 gave the sets to 11?

Also when I tear down the primary site (completely) how do I move, promote,
migrate the masternode (right now the config sees the masternode as 1, but
when I drop 1-5 at some point from 11/12, I don't have a masternode 1
anymore, so how do I configure the system to treat 11 as masternode?

Thanks
Tory

I recommend running move set with a preamble containing admin conninfo to
all your nodes. That way auto wait for can do its thing.

Most of your questions are answered in
http://www.slony.info/documentation/2.2/stmtmoveset.html

Move set will reverse the subscription chain between 2 and 11, so 11->2
11->1

If after your move set completes you can make further changes to your
subscription network with
http://www.slony.info/documentation/2.2/stmtresubscribenode.html

Once your move set completes node 11 is your master node(for those tables) 
that is exactly what move set does, it makes node 11 the origin(master).

Slony does not support renaming node, don't try to make some other node in 
the cluster be renamed to node 1 after this.

I encourage you to setup a test/staging cluster in your configuration and 
try various scenarios out before executing the commands on your 
production cluster.

Thanks Steve,

i've done all this quite a few times, switchovers and moving sets. But I
was not 100% sure if I could just go from 1-11 when 2 was replicating to
11.  Earlier today I went a head and did some moving so that 1 is
replicating to 11, so the switchover will be as clean as moving sets to 11
and 1 will become the secondary, just to make sure I didn't introduce any
weirdness.

And thanks for the heads up on the masternode. I would never try to rename
anything inside the cluster, but since our scripts all require a masternode
switch, I was not 100% sure that the masternode was in fact just the
primary db at that time

Thanks again for taking the time!!

Tory

Subject: [Slony1-general] Setting up replicating database to receive
 log-shipping files - how to do?
Message-ID: <DM5PR18MB0954280B9464502626C892F898D20@DM5PR18MB0954.namprd18.prod.outlook.com>

I am working on setting up a secondary machine, at another location, with roughly the same structure as our primary machine here.   The current machine is running Slony 2.0 (I think 2.0.7 but cannot recall for certain) against Postgres 8.4.13, the newer one is running Slony 2.1.4 against Postgres 9.2.15.

The main machine uses slony to generate log-shipping files, which are then sent out to other servers we maintain to feed the local database copies on them.  The new remote machine is intended as a backup to this system, eventually to become a replacement for the current machine.  To this end, I was asked to get the new remote machine set up to both create log files, and to receive the log files we're sending to the other machines we maintain.

I have managed to install Slony 2.1.4 on the new machine, and I have verified that I can replicate changes input manually on the new machine.  Changes from the log files being generated by the old machine, however, don't replicate on the new system.  I believe, from what I've found online, that the cause of this is the line 'set session_replication_role to replica;' found near the beginning of the log files.  If I'm understanding correctly, that is forcing the system to bypass the triggers that Slony needs to run the replication setup.

Is there some setting I can change in the Slony instance on the log-shipping generating machine to prevent the log files from being sent out with that line, or something I can change on the receiving machine that will allow it to ignore the line in question?  Or something else, perhaps, which can work to resolve this?  What options do I have for getting this setup to work?

Thank you,

Generally people don't generate logshipping files in a cascaded fashion. 
Can't you just send the sames files to multiple locations.

Also your missing something in your setup. You need at least 3 nodes wiht 
log shipping, the origin, a replica that slon is generating the log shipping 
files(B, which is a proper replica with a slon) and node C the machine 
receiving your logshipping files.

A-->slon->B->logshipping files--->C


You can just then also ship the files to nodes D and E

If you stripped the session replication role from the .sql files (which you 
could do with a script I guess) you could then do something like

A-->slon->B->log shipping files->C--->slon--->D

where you are actually running 2 slony clusters one with nodes A,B and one 
with nodes C,D (I guess this is what your trying to do?)

The set session_replication_role is added to the .sql files by slon in 
remote_worker.c (see archive_open) and can't be disabled without changing 
the code
