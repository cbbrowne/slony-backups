Subject: [Slony1-general] Question about new install from Postgresql repo
Message-ID: <F024DCE3402750409CD407C414C07E1A16B6E99D@BY2PRD0811MB404.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi, I just built a Centos 6 64-bit test server, added the postgresql repo and installed the following:

# curl -O http://yum.postgresql.org/9.2/redhat/rhel-6-i386/pgdg-centos91-9.1-4.noarch.rpm
# yum localinstall pgdg-centos92-9.2-4.noarch.rpm
# yum install postgresql
# yum install postgresql-server
# yum install slony1-92-2.1.2

Where do I obtain the tools directory from? Also - when I try to execute "/etc/init.d/slony1-92 <any command>", nothing is returned. Just goes back to the commandline. Am I missing a prerequisite? I thought that the above install would be sufficient. :/

Thanks,
Mike

The ward way would be to DELETE all tables and sequences form sl_table 
and sl_sequence, who's taboid and seqoid don't appear in pg_class.
