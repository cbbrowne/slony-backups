Greetings everyone,


We've recently started considering Slony for purpose of migrating PostgreSQL from old physical server to a new virtualized and "updated" platform. So far, all our tests worked quite well. However, I'm having trouble finding any documentation to prove or disprove that the following scenario is supported and/or will work properly (initial testing was positive though).


We would like to setup streaming replication between future Slony subscriber and our DR site beforehand, ie. before we introduce Slony. This would save us time and additional work post migration.


It would look something like this:

"New B" (disaster recovery site)   <---- Streaming replication ----  "New A" <--------Slony replication ----- "Old A"  ------ existing SR ------> "Old B" (DR site)

  *   Streaming replication between "New A" and "New B" would be setup first
  *   Then we would setup Slony replication between "Old A" and "New A"
  *   Slony replication Set would be moved from "Old A" to "New A"
  *   Slon process would be stopped and Slony Schema would be removed

Has anyone done something similar? Are there potential downsides to this idea?

We are using slony1-91-II-2.1.4 and Postgres 9.1 on RHEL 6, later we will most likely do the same type of migration from 9.1 to 9.5.

Any response is greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
Zarko

I've done this. It works fine.

Make sure you install the slony extensions on Old B and New B in the event you need to fail over to one of the B nodes.

I can see no reason it wouldn't work.  Slony does things that are
pretty much disjoint from what streaming replication does, so they
won't be able to ste on each others' toes.

If you're using Slony, you might as well go to 9.6.latest while you're
at it.  You won't save time by replicating yet again to another
virtual server, and the chances that going to 9.6 will break something
are much smaller than the chances that staying on the now-defunct 9.1
will.  There have already been data loss bugs that were fixed since
9.1 went out of support, i.e. 9.1 didn't get those fixes applied.

That setup will work nicely with what I hope will become a routine
operation, namely upgrading major versions. :)

Best,
David.

Thank you all for the answers. We'll proceed with this approach most likely.

Unfortunately, we won't be able to upgrade straight away. We have to take this environment one step at the time.
Though, now that you mentioned data loss bugs  we might speed it up and look into specifics more.

Thanks again!
