Hi Christopher !
I made changes on the controversial parts based on solutions suggested
by Steve Singer.

I don?t know if github warns about the changes to you, so sorry by the
noise if they do.

Can you review again if the changes are satisfactory ?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Lock set behaviour difference between 2.0 and 2.1
Message-ID: <1352395905.8369.YahooMailNeo@web133204.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hi Guys,

I was just taking a look at the changes to lockset() between 2.0 and 2.1 and noticed it now uses a lock on the row in sl_set rather than a table lock on sl_config_lock.

I was wondering, does this now make it possible to do something along the lines of:

TRY {
LOCK SET ( ID = 1, ORIGIN = 1);
LOCK SET ( ID = 2, ORIGIN = 1);
}
ON ERROR ( blah }
MOVE SET ( ID = 1, OLD ORIGIN = 1, NEW ORIGIN = 2);
WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN = 1, CONFIRMED = ALL, WAIT ON = 1, TIMEOUT = 0);
MOVE SET ( ID = 2, OLD ORIGIN = 1, NEW ORIGIN = 2);
WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN = 1, CONFIRMED = ALL, WAIT ON = 1, TIMEOUT = 0);

(Or even wrap the move sets in a try too?)

The reason I ask is we're currently using 2.0.7 and when we move a bunch of sets between nodes it'd be ideal if they were all locked before they were moved.

Sorry if I've got the wrong end of the stick here, or this has already been answered somewhere, I did do a good search before posting!

Thanks
Glyn

Hello. I?ve read that it is possible to add a table to a running replication (http://slony.info/documentation/2.1/modifyingthings.html), currently I?m using altperl scripts to manage the replication, I would like to know if its possible to add a new table using altperl scripts, can you guys please point me in the right direction?.

Thanks a lot.

One approach to take is to first define a new set in slon_tools.conf that
includes the new table, then use the altperl tools to create the new set,
subscribe nodes to it, then finally (if you want) merge the new set into
the existing replication set.  If you do merge sets, the final step is to
edit slon_tools.conf to remove the new set and and move the new table in
the existing set.

Hello. 

Thank you for your response. If I understand correctly what I have to do is this: 

On the slon_tool.conf I have only to add this:


"set2" => {
"set_id" => 2,
"table_id" => 2,
"sequence_id" => 2,
"pkeyedtables" => ["testtable"],
#"keyedtables" => {},
#"sequences" => [],
},

And leave everything else intact (set 1, name of cluster, etc). Then I have to run this commands:

# slonik_create_set 2 | slonik 
# slonik_subscribe_set 2 2 | slonik (number of set: 2, number of node 2)
# slonik_subscribe_set 2 3 | slonik (number of set: 2, number of node 3)

Do I have to run slon_kill and then slon_start ?

Thanks

I think you'll need to increase the table_id and sequence_ids to account
for the tables already in set1.

No the LOCK SET needs to be done as part of the same transaction as the 
MOVE SET.  You can't do that across the bounds of a try block. You also 
can't do WAIT FOR EVENT inside of a try block.

WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN = 1, CONFIRMED = ALL, WAIT ON = 1, TIMEOUT = 0);
> MOVE SET ( ID = 2, OLD ORIGIN = 1, NEW ORIGIN = 2);
> WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN = 1, CONFIRMED = ALL, WAIT ON = 1, TIMEOUT = 0);

Why can't you just do

try {
LOCK SET ( ID = 1, ORIGIN = 1);
LOCK SET ( ID = 2, ORIGIN = 1);
MOVE SET ( ID = 1, OLD ORIGIN = 1, NEW ORIGIN = 2);
MOVE SET ( ID = 2, OLD ORIGIN = 1, NEW ORIGIN = 2);
}
WAIT FOR EVENT(ORIGIN=1, CONFIRMED=ALL...)

(I haven't actually tested the above but I think it will work in cases 
were both sets are on the same origin).

Hello. I just wanted to let you know that thanks to your advice adding new tables to the replication has worked perfectly, including merging the sets.

Hi Steve,

I've just tried the above on 2.1.2 and I get the same error message as on 2.0.7? when I try to lock the second set:


"cannot lock set - admin connection already in transaction"

I'm guessing "lock set" and "move set" have to be run consecutively?

Actually the issue is that the lock set needs to be in its own 
transaction so it can't really be used in an 'active' try block except 
as the first command (which the documentation say)

The message you are getting was apparently added with this commit.

commit d013758b4823e2d386a2a0738e0d9a5534f11556
Author: Jan Wieck <JanWieck at yahoo.com>
Date:   Thu Mar 18 22:47:00 2004 +0000

     Added "lock set", "unlock set" and "move set" commands
     to slonik. "lock set" requires to be the first statement
     in a transaction since it actually needs to commit the
     lockSet() call and then wait until the lock's xmax <=
     xmin. To prevent accidential misuse we don't allow other
     statements in the same transaction.

     Jan


One solution is to allow LOCK SET to take/lock multiple sets at once 
(this change won't happen before slony 2.3), but I'm not sure if there 
is a different solution.

I think you could still do

LOCK SET(...)
LOCK SET(...)
MOVE SET(...)
MOVE SET(...)

just NOT inside of a TRY block.

Yeah, it's just nice to be able to unlock the sets locked so far if something goes wrong half way through.

Subject: [Slony1-general] replication fails to due bad DNS at startup,
 requires slony restart to fix
Message-ID: <k7riv0$dnv$1@ger.gmane.org>


This feedback concerns Slony 2.1.2, being used with PostgreSQL 9.1.

We're using it on Amazon EC2, which ads the complication that the
internal IP address of the machine changes every time it starts up.

On Friday, our underlying hardware failed on the master, and we had to
stop/start the master DB instance, to move it to new hardware.

When slony started, the name of the server itself was still resolving to
the old internal IP, so this happened:

###
2012-11-09 21:35:20 EST FATAL  main: Cannot connect to local database -
could not connect to server: Con
nection timed out
        Is the server running on host "db.example.com" (10.79.78.214)
and accepting
        TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
###

After that, Slony was never able to correct itself, even long after the
TTL for the related DNS record would have expired. It took a manual
stop/start to get things going in.

Perhaps Slony aggressively caches DNS? Or perhaps it could recover from
this "FATAL" condition? Is this expected behavior, or should slony
behave better in the face of temporary DNS problems?

Thanks for insights!

   Mark

I don't think most programs do any sort of TTL expiry of DNS lookups. It
seems reasonable to me to restart a program upon DNS configuration changes.

Slony does nothing concerning cacheing DNS.

It simply uses the libpq function, PQconnectdb(conninfo) to connect to
databases.

All the relevant code is localized to src/slon/dbutils.c, so you can
poke at the code if you want to.

I think you'll find that other clients that attempted to use libpq,
such as psql, would fail pretty much identically.

Is it possible that your libc is doing cacheing?  If *that's* the
case, and I'm suspicious of it, then you really would need to restart
the slon to get "unstuck" from what libc has cached on you...

More likely, the system resolver is pointing at a caching name server.

Thanks for prompt answers, everyone.

I'll pursue this as an issue with our use of Ubuntu on Amazon/EC2.

Message-ID: <7742DD496427B743BC8B7BBF6D380BA040A6A187@EXCHANGE10.geo-comm.local>

I have compiled Slony1 2.1.2 on Windows Server 2008 R2 (x64) against PostgreSQL 9.0 x64 and I am getting the following errors on startup.


*         Slony-I schema version is 2.1.2

*         please upgrade Slony-I schema to version 2.1.1

*         main: Node has wrong Slony-I schema or module version loaded

The machines I am trying to run 2.1.2 has never had another version of Slony1 on them.  Why would Slony1 2.1.2 want the 2.1.1 schema?  And what can I do to resolve the issue?

Sorry, my bad I think.
Change the file
config_msvc.h

#define SLONY_I_VERSION_STRING  "2.1.1"
#define SLONY_I_VERSION_STRING_DEC 2,1,1

To instead say
#define SLONY_I_VERSION_STRING  "2.1.2"
#define SLONY_I_VERSION_STRING_DEC 2,1,2


and recompile everything

Did you do a clean compile (and then install) the slony1_funcs.dll ?

Yes,

Deleted my old source folder, copied a clean one in place, made the change, then compiled.

Do you maybe have to restart the postgres.exe service after copying the 
new slony1_funcs.dll into the lib directory? (I'm guessing, I don't see 
another obvious reference to 2.1.1 in the code for the DLL and setting 
up a windows development box always takes me a bit of time)

Yep,

Restarted the service after copying the new slon1_funcs.dll.  If you want, I can setup a Windows Development machine for you once I get home as I can determine who gets access to that easier than I can at work.

Do you maybe have to restart the postgres.exe service after copying the new slony1_funcs.dll into the lib directory? (I'm guessing, I don't see another obvious reference to 2.1.1 in the code for the DLL and setting up a windows development box always takes me a bit of time)

I have images on go-grid that I can bring up for windows development. 
Starting one up, grabing the version of slony in question, compiling it 
etc, I just need to have the time to do that. I'll try to get to it 
later this week but no promises.

I don't think that restarting the slon manually is the right solution to 
this problem.

Whatever really causes it (libc probably) doesn't matter. Changing DNS 
entries to redirect services to a different IP address is often used in 
disaster recovery procedures (failover). We should not require an 
outside process or worse an admin to restart things in a case like that.

I don't know what exactly is the right answer. From behind libpq it is 
rather difficult to tell what exactly went wrong when trying to connect 
to a database. A generic answer to that would be to do only X attempts 
to (re)connect, then restart the entire slon process. But that has 
pitfalls. If someone has shut down a replica for maintenance purposes, 
all slons would constantly restart in that interval, which would prevent 
longer running tasks like subscriptions. So this would have to go hand 
in hand with some new configuration option(s), like "ignore connection 
failures to this node WRT restarting".

Some input from the user community would certainly help.

Did you also stop the windows slon service, copy the new slon.exe and 
then restart it? ( if you don't stop the service before copying slon.exe 
the copy will fail because the file is in use)

I've  tried the 2.1.2 tar from the website plus the two changes I 
mentioned in config_msvc.h on a Win32 (not 64) machine and I am able to 
init the cluster via slonik and the slons seem to be running.

Do you have a clean machine you can install this on? ie not the machine 
that had binaries of your previous 2.1.2 without the fix installed?  I'm 
not sure why this works for me but not for you.

I actually created a clean Server 2008 R2 VM on my desktop to try it.  After install PostgreSQL 9.0.10-1 x64 & PostGIS 2.0 (which is the type of data we need to replicate) I get another error stating "The program can't start because LIBPQ.dll is missing from your computer.  Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."  Never seen it before so that is confusing me.

I have seen that error when trying to run slon.exe or slonik.exe from 
the source directories.  If/when I copy the binaries to c:\Program 
Files\Postgresql\9.1\bin  (or whatever) and run them from there it finds 
libpq.dll in that same directory.

Hmm, I will just have to wire a quick WIX installer (yeah right) to deploy it on our servers then, once I find out what all I need to include.

Followed your suggestion and copied slon.exe & slonik.exe to C:\PostgreSQL\9.0\bin and I'm no longer getting that error.  However it is now complaining that it can't find MSVCR90.dll and I have the 2008 Visual C++ Redistributable installed (both x86 & x84_64).

Is msvcr90.dll anywhere on your system?  If so where? I  would have 
expected this to be included in the runtime.

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326922 seems to indicate that
Vcredist_x86.exe will install these.

Yep, the 32 bit version of the Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable is installed.  And if I do a "dir /s MSVCR90.dll" from the root of C: it finds the file in a location contained in my PATH variable.  It has me stumped.

Even though I have installed both the 32-bit & 64-bit versions of the Visual C 2008 Redistributable, it is not in my path.  After adding C:\Windows\SysWOW64 to get the 32-bit version of MSVCR90.dll in my path, I am told that slon.exe has "made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly."

This is really confusing me since I have compiled it on a system with the same components installed before and it ran.

Does adding the 64 bit version to your path help.
I thought you had said you were using 64 bit postgresql (which would 
require a 64 bit slony1_funcs.dll, I would assume)

Nope, adding the 64-bit version to my path doesn't help.  Same error.  I am using the 64-bit version of PostgreSQL, however Windows still shows that slon.exe is a 32-bit process when I build the 2.1.1 version (which works fine).

Update, I realized I forgot to copy the slon.exe.manifest & slonik.exe.manifest along with the executables.  Looking at those files, slon.exe & slonik.exe are looking in the GAC for msvcr90.dll.  However, even though the files are present in the GAC neither app can find them.  Also copying a working 2.1.1 build from another machine will not run on this machine......

Nope, adding the 64-bit version to my path doesn't help.  Same error.  I am using the 64-bit version of PostgreSQL, however Windows still shows that slon.exe is a 32-bit process when I build the 2.1.1 version (which works fine).

Does adding the 64 bit version to your path help.
I thought you had said you were using 64 bit postgresql (which would require a 64 bit slony1_funcs.dll, I would assume)

Subject: [Slony1-general] Trigger based replication with ENABLE REPLICA
	triggers and session_replication_role best practice(s)
Message-ID: <1663203.fSACAC55JW@smadev.internal.net>

Hello, (pls ignore my previous msg, the address is internal)

You might think that i am in the wrong list since i explicitly mention DBmirror here, but my question is
DISABLE/ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ] TRIGGER , and session_replication_role related
and I have the idea that maybe those features were introduced specifically for Slony, hence why i ask
for your opinions here. Pls read on.

we have based all our replication infrastructure on a heavily hacked version of DBMirror, which now runs in a 
single master (office DB) -> multiple slaves (vessels DBs) mode for 80+ slaves and about 300 tables and in 
multiple masters (the same vessels DBs as above) (having partitions of the data) -> single slave (the same office db as above) mode 
for just two tables. 
Now we are in the process of designing a new solution which requires to have some form of multi-master functionality,
without being so much concerned about conflict resolution at this stage.
The issue that we are facing is to prevent replication data originating from a vessel DB and consumed into the office DB,
(or replication data originating from the office DB and consumed into a vessel DB) to be bounced back to the
originating server because of the invocation of the DBMirror trigger.

We have thought of :
Solution 1)
explicitly disabling the triggers at the start of the transaction and re-enabling them,
but that would require knowledge of the name of table in question prior to execution of the replication command,
but in our case this not known unless parsing the SQL file which came from the originating server.
Since the number of those multi-master tables is not large, we could explicit insert the 
ALTER TABLE <tblname> DISABLE TRIGGER <tblname>_dbmirror_trig commands prior to actual SQL execution
for each table involved and then insert the respective 
ALTER TABLE <tblname> ENABLE TRIGGER <tblname>_dbmirror_trig commands after the SQL execution.
However this would require hardcoding those commands into the code which runs the replication SQL,
and this has many and obvious disadvantages.

Then i looked upon :
Solution 2)
the ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER in combination with session_replication_role.
Setting default ALTER DATABASE dbname SET session_replication_role TO REPLICA  (single master + multi-master ones) 
in combination with ALTER TABLE ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER <tblname>_dbmirror_trig for *all* tables involved in replication
would allow the default behavior of INSERTS/UPDATES/DELETES to result in firing the DBmirror trigger, which would work
similar to the default way it has been running for the single direction replicated tables.
Then in the code which plays the replication SQLs for the multi-master tables we would simply set smth like :
BEGIN ;
SET local session_replication_role TO origin;
<execute SQL here>
END;
preventing the trigger to be called, and thus eliminating the bounce-back effect.

One thing that worries me is setting the database-wide session_replication_role to smth different than the default.
In our case, it would be ideal to be able to set session_replication_role to some value which would have 
the complimentary effect of REPLICA, smth like e.g. NOREPLICA which would result in on-demand temporary
disablement of the triggers while leaving session_replication_role to a non-REPLICA value (such as the default value=origin).
In short I would like to have the triggers always executed by default (acting as master), except the situation
where we read (or play/replay) SQL originating from the one *big* Master (the office).
(in Office we plan to have the triggers always executed, regardless of the origin of the data, so in the Office
everything remains at the defaults)

One third solution would be to :
Solution 3)
make the code updating those multi-master tables, replication-aware by putting 
SET local session_replication_role TO REPLICA; inside the affecting transactions. But this also has
the obvious disadvantage of making application and system logic blend together, and also
making the app programmer prone to errors.

The most elegant solution IMHO is the 2nd but i am concerned that setting the 
database-wide session_replication_role to smth different than the default might just 
hide some future risks.

What are your thoughts on that?

Thank you a lot for any input.

Yes, they were.

It also does heavy locking, and does not turn off rules, so 
using session_replication_role (SRR) is much better.

Not good. Pretty dangerous unless you are 100% sure that every application 
logging into the database is aware of that setting. That's backwards of the 
optimal solution:

Well, this is exactly the use case that session_replication_role was 
designed for, so I would prefer to see stronger reasons for 
rejecting it.

Thank you for your answer.

Let me first describe our setup :
1) One Office Database is our central system and is physically located at our data center,
For the majority of the replicated tables (~300) this database acts as the master and the Vessels
described below, as slaves.
2) Many (80+) Vessel databases, which are subsets (+ some local data) of the Office Database,
and are physically located at vessels(ships) at sea. For only two tables those databases 
act as masters and the Office database as slave.

At the Vessels' side, the tables are categorized in:
1) majority of tables (about 300) are slave tables (Vessel acting as slave), no trigger there, 
Vessels passively replay replication SQL data generated by the Office (via exchange of SQL files)
2) two tables for which the vessel act as the master (dbmirror trigger exists only on vessel, the office
behaves as slave for those two tables)
3) two new tables which we must configure as multi-master, (dbmirror triggers must exist both at Vessel
and at the Office)

It is this case 3) that we must deal with. At the vessel side (we don't care for the Office for the moment) 
we want to eliminate bounce back while reading SQL from the master, therefore we would like to allow
triggers operating freely as by default on all occasions except in the program which reads and executes
SQL generated and sent by the Office.

I thought it was the opposite. By 
1) setting the database-wide session_replication_role to REPLICA
2) Setting all existing non-replication-related triggers as ENABLE ALWAYS 
3) Setting all replication triggers (the existing two(single-master) + the two new multi-master ones) AS ENABLE REPLICA
4) Touch only one system program (the one which executes SQL from the master), and SET local session_replication_role TO origin , 
5) Leave all other apps untouched

I think I can have the correct behaviour, without ever touching the applications at all.
The apps need not be aware of any setting.

Now that i read your answer again, I think i did not manage to make myself clear enough,
hence you might have thought a complimentary situation than the one we really have.

Intuitively thinking, and following this thread/post by Chris Browne : http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2008-04/msg00786.php
i would suppose that tables with triggers configured as ORIGIN or LOCAL imply tables 
for which the server acts as prime master/origin, while tables with triggers configured 
as REPLICA imply tables residing in a system acting as slave.

If (by solution 3) i left the Vessel configuration at its defaults, and only configure the triggers for those 
two new multi-master tables as ENABLE REPLICA, then i might get away with leaving the 
program which reads replication SQL from the Office intact, but i pay the price of having
to force all apps to issue : SET local session_replication_role TO REPLICA;

So with solution 2) i have to change all existing triggers + change one single program 
(the one which reads the SQL files from the Office), 
while with solution 3) i would have to worry about all applications dealing with those tables.

Am I missing something?

Can't you just make the dbmirror log trigger a 'normal' trigger that is 
enabled everywhere.  You would then modify 
dbmirror.pl to connect with session_replication_role='replica'.  The 
dbmirror triggers won't fire on the replica in response to data being 
sent from dbmirror so there will be no rows in the pendingData table to 
bounce back.

The application on the ships would connect with out touching 
session_replication_role so the dbmirror trigger would fire for any inserts 
they do leaving you rows in pendingData to pull elsewhere.

This is basically how slony works, except slony installs a deny access 
trigger on the replica tables to prevent writes.
