Hi Christopher !
I made changes on the controversial parts based on solutions suggested
by Steve Singer.

I don?t know if github warns about the changes to you, so sorry by the
noise if they do.

Can you review again if the changes are satisfactory ?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Lock set behaviour difference between 2.0 and 2.1
Message-ID: <1352395905.8369.YahooMailNeo@web133204.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hi Guys,

I was just taking a look at the changes to lockset() between 2.0 and 2.1 and noticed it now uses a lock on the row in sl_set rather than a table lock on sl_config_lock.

I was wondering, does this now make it possible to do something along the lines of:

TRY {
LOCK SET ( ID = 1, ORIGIN = 1);
LOCK SET ( ID = 2, ORIGIN = 1);
}
ON ERROR ( blah }
MOVE SET ( ID = 1, OLD ORIGIN = 1, NEW ORIGIN = 2);
WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN = 1, CONFIRMED = ALL, WAIT ON = 1, TIMEOUT = 0);
MOVE SET ( ID = 2, OLD ORIGIN = 1, NEW ORIGIN = 2);
WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN = 1, CONFIRMED = ALL, WAIT ON = 1, TIMEOUT = 0);

(Or even wrap the move sets in a try too?)

The reason I ask is we're currently using 2.0.7 and when we move a bunch of sets between nodes it'd be ideal if they were all locked before they were moved.

Sorry if I've got the wrong end of the stick here, or this has already been answered somewhere, I did do a good search before posting!

Thanks
Glyn

Hello. I?ve read that it is possible to add a table to a running replication (http://slony.info/documentation/2.1/modifyingthings.html), currently I?m using altperl scripts to manage the replication, I would like to know if its possible to add a new table using altperl scripts, can you guys please point me in the right direction?.

Thanks a lot.

One approach to take is to first define a new set in slon_tools.conf that
includes the new table, then use the altperl tools to create the new set,
subscribe nodes to it, then finally (if you want) merge the new set into
the existing replication set.  If you do merge sets, the final step is to
edit slon_tools.conf to remove the new set and and move the new table in
the existing set.

Hello. 

Thank you for your response. If I understand correctly what I have to do is this: 

On the slon_tool.conf I have only to add this:


"set2" => {
"set_id" => 2,
"table_id" => 2,
"sequence_id" => 2,
"pkeyedtables" => ["testtable"],
#"keyedtables" => {},
#"sequences" => [],
},

And leave everything else intact (set 1, name of cluster, etc). Then I have to run this commands:

# slonik_create_set 2 | slonik 
# slonik_subscribe_set 2 2 | slonik (number of set: 2, number of node 2)
# slonik_subscribe_set 2 3 | slonik (number of set: 2, number of node 3)

Do I have to run slon_kill and then slon_start ?

Thanks

I think you'll need to increase the table_id and sequence_ids to account
for the tables already in set1.

No the LOCK SET needs to be done as part of the same transaction as the 
MOVE SET.  You can't do that across the bounds of a try block. You also 
can't do WAIT FOR EVENT inside of a try block.

WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN = 1, CONFIRMED = ALL, WAIT ON = 1, TIMEOUT = 0);
> MOVE SET ( ID = 2, OLD ORIGIN = 1, NEW ORIGIN = 2);
> WAIT FOR EVENT (ORIGIN = 1, CONFIRMED = ALL, WAIT ON = 1, TIMEOUT = 0);

Why can't you just do

try {
LOCK SET ( ID = 1, ORIGIN = 1);
LOCK SET ( ID = 2, ORIGIN = 1);
MOVE SET ( ID = 1, OLD ORIGIN = 1, NEW ORIGIN = 2);
MOVE SET ( ID = 2, OLD ORIGIN = 1, NEW ORIGIN = 2);
}
WAIT FOR EVENT(ORIGIN=1, CONFIRMED=ALL...)

(I haven't actually tested the above but I think it will work in cases 
were both sets are on the same origin).

Hello. I just wanted to let you know that thanks to your advice adding new tables to the replication has worked perfectly, including merging the sets.

Hi Steve,

I've just tried the above on 2.1.2 and I get the same error message as on 2.0.7? when I try to lock the second set:


"cannot lock set - admin connection already in transaction"

I'm guessing "lock set" and "move set" have to be run consecutively?

Actually the issue is that the lock set needs to be in its own 
transaction so it can't really be used in an 'active' try block except 
as the first command (which the documentation say)

The message you are getting was apparently added with this commit.

commit d013758b4823e2d386a2a0738e0d9a5534f11556
Author: Jan Wieck <JanWieck at yahoo.com>
Date:   Thu Mar 18 22:47:00 2004 +0000

     Added "lock set", "unlock set" and "move set" commands
     to slonik. "lock set" requires to be the first statement
     in a transaction since it actually needs to commit the
     lockSet() call and then wait until the lock's xmax <=
     xmin. To prevent accidential misuse we don't allow other
     statements in the same transaction.

     Jan


One solution is to allow LOCK SET to take/lock multiple sets at once 
(this change won't happen before slony 2.3), but I'm not sure if there 
is a different solution.

I think you could still do

LOCK SET(...)
LOCK SET(...)
MOVE SET(...)
MOVE SET(...)

just NOT inside of a TRY block.

Yeah, it's just nice to be able to unlock the sets locked so far if something goes wrong half way through.

Subject: [Slony1-general] replication fails to due bad DNS at startup,
 requires slony restart to fix
Message-ID: <k7riv0$dnv$1@ger.gmane.org>


This feedback concerns Slony 2.1.2, being used with PostgreSQL 9.1.

We're using it on Amazon EC2, which ads the complication that the
internal IP address of the machine changes every time it starts up.

On Friday, our underlying hardware failed on the master, and we had to
stop/start the master DB instance, to move it to new hardware.

When slony started, the name of the server itself was still resolving to
the old internal IP, so this happened:

###
2012-11-09 21:35:20 EST FATAL  main: Cannot connect to local database -
could not connect to server: Con
nection timed out
        Is the server running on host "db.example.com" (10.79.78.214)
and accepting
        TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
###

After that, Slony was never able to correct itself, even long after the
TTL for the related DNS record would have expired. It took a manual
stop/start to get things going in.

Perhaps Slony aggressively caches DNS? Or perhaps it could recover from
this "FATAL" condition? Is this expected behavior, or should slony
behave better in the face of temporary DNS problems?

Thanks for insights!

   Mark

I don't think most programs do any sort of TTL expiry of DNS lookups. It
seems reasonable to me to restart a program upon DNS configuration changes.

Slony does nothing concerning cacheing DNS.

It simply uses the libpq function, PQconnectdb(conninfo) to connect to
databases.

All the relevant code is localized to src/slon/dbutils.c, so you can
poke at the code if you want to.

I think you'll find that other clients that attempted to use libpq,
such as psql, would fail pretty much identically.

Is it possible that your libc is doing cacheing?  If *that's* the
case, and I'm suspicious of it, then you really would need to restart
the slon to get "unstuck" from what libc has cached on you...

More likely, the system resolver is pointing at a caching name server.

Best,

Thanks for prompt answers, everyone.

I'll pursue this as an issue with our use of Ubuntu on Amazon/EC2.
