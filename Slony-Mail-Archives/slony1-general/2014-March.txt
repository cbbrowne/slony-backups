Does your schema have any custom operators ?

When you say that you restored an 8.4 DB did you do this with pg_dump? 
pg_upgrade? or some other method?

Subject: [Slony1-general] question about upgrading 2.1 to 2.2 steps from
	manual
Message-ID: <CALd+dce=d13Sfs=ggNMr0XHD1Obpmwr0UOBWkf5gJ-e13w74yA@mail.gmail.com>

In the docs, a suggested method to upgrade 2.1 to to 2.2 is as follows:


   1. Use SLONIK LOCK SET to lock all sets, so that no new changes are
   being injected into the log tables
   2. Set slon parameter slon_config_cleanup_interval to a very low value
   (a few seconds) so that the slon cleanup thread will trim data out of
   sl_log_1 and sl_log_2 immediately
   3. Restart slon for each node and let it run through a cleanup cycle to
   empty out sl_log_1 and sl_log_2 on all nodes.
   4. Verify that sl_log_1 and sl_log_2 are empty on all nodes in the
   cluster.
   5. Use SLONIK UPDATE FUNCTIONS against each node to upgrade to version
   2.2
   6. Use SLONIK UNLOCK SET to unlock all sets

Based on my experience and other reading, I think between steps 4 and 5
should be:


   1. stop slon
   2. install new version of slony

then after step 5, restart slon.

Is that the correct place to perform the install? Or can/should that be
done between steps 2 and 3?

Also, will the lock set survive restarting slon? I thought it took out an
exclusive lock on all tables, but if you stop the process, the locks would
then go away.

Nice timing Vick; I was just thinking about the upgrade steps myself yesterday.

I think that although the lock set takes out exclusive locks on the individual tables, the actual locking mechanism is by adding a "lockedset" trigger to all the tables - so it should survive the slon restart.

However my concern is that I have many replication sets, and as I recall it's not possible to lock more than one set at a time - or has this changed as of 2.2?

There's definitely a need for some clarification on those upgrade steps.

Subject: [Slony1-general] slon process "stops" after 58 minutes
Message-ID: <CALd+dcezuG192K2n6CVBRpFwbk5cWqSHOr_x2HvAsmoq=70mXg@mail.gmail.com>

So in prep for upgrading from 2.1 to 2.2 this weekend, I upgraded my
server's OS from FreeBSD 9.1 to 9.2 (a fairly minor update, as OS updates
go).

Since the upgrade, the slon connected to the replica DB on that upgraded
server will stop after just about 58 to 59 minutes. Restarting the slon
daemon allows the replication to continue and fairly quickly catch up.

By "stop" I mean there is nothing visibly going on -- replication stalls
and nothing is logged.

Here is the tail end of my log file from a few minutes ago. The slon
process was started at 8:48am.

at this point nothing more gets logged.

Looking at the activity in the DB, I see the 5 connections from this slon,
with all but one having a query start time of 09:46:44. This is the query
that was running for over 10 minutes:

datid            | 16392
datname          | vkmlm
pid              | 7159

state            | idle
query            | begin;lock table "_mailermailer".sl_config_lock;select
"_mailermailer".cleanupEvent('10 minutes'::interval);commit;

pg_cancel_backend() will not kill that query. I did a
pg_terminate_backend() and it got rid of that process, but the rest are
still seemingly stuck and nothing is logging from slon.

Any ideas? This is so confusing because it is such an odd time interval
before it locks up. What's magical about 58 minutes?

I have similar problems. It is 45 minutes +/- remote_listen_timeout for me.

[...]

I my case it's "master" on FreeBSD 9.2 and a "slave" on FreeBSD 9.1. It
seems that in some time around net.inet.tcp.keepidle (sysctl -a to
check) when keepalive from OS kicks in the transsmission will be droped
depending on your keepalive configuration. You should also see error
messages in postgresql logs like:

getsockopt(TCP_KEEPCNT) failed: Protocol not available

> Any ideas? This is so confusing because it is such an odd time interval

My wild guess is:

http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2013-November/075781.html


The problem I have is, that slon on slave reconnects to database on
master but the backend process on master stays forever taking
resournces. From first connection I have like 1 hour "in
production" - everything is just fine, then comes keepalive + 
remote_listen_timeout, drops the connection and slon reconnects every
remote_listen_timeout creating new backend processes.

I have one simple workaround for this: crontab + slon restart every
hour.

Cheers,
thorkill

PS. Postgresql 9.3.2 used on both nodes.

Wow. These symptoms line up *exactly*.

I notice the getsockopt error is logged a handful of times when slon starts
and connects.

I applied the patch from the above message thread and rebooted the kernel.
When slon started, no getsockopt errors were reported. I'll let you know in
an hour what happens.

By the way, my net.inet.tcp.keepidle is 7200000, which should be 2 hours.

fail. that patch doesn't help.

i will now try to get postgres to imagine these new TCP_KEEP* socket
options do not exist, like it was in FreeBSD 9.1.

You can turn keep alive's off on the slon end with
tcp_keepalive

You want to run step 3 with the OLD slon, thew new slon won't work yet.

So yes, between steps 4 and 5 is when you would install the new slon

I'm fairly sure this keep alive is a red herring here. In FreeBSD 9.1,
postgres complains with the same getsockopt error, and all that does is
cause postgres to not do the corresponding setsockopt.  It makes no
difference if you patch FreeBSD to have the getsockopt succeed.

Furthermore, setting the keeplalive timeout in freebsd down to 150 seconds
doesn't cause the connection to fail sooner. In fact on my running systems,
the timeout was 2 hours. So something else is funky going on here.

FWIW, I did not recompile postgres or slony after upgrading to freebsd 9.2
from 9.1. Also, my master is still running 9.1 and never locks up.
Something freebsd-related for sure.

But i will try to disable slony's keepalive just in the slim chance that it
is related.

Also, my connections are never idle. There is constant write activity on
this database, so nobody should ever be sending any keepalive packets.
