Subject: [Slony1-general] Question on failover on slony 1.23
Message-ID: <1338575996.81198.YahooMailNeo@web29704.mail.ird.yahoo.com>



?
Dear all,

I used the slony v1.23 to create a cluster on a postgres db v8.0.x, I am using this old version of slony since, due to constraints on software using the db I cannot upgrade the postgres version.
The database to be put in safety using slony is composed of 4 databases.
The main goal I need to reach is to have a master and a slave containing the same data and, in case of failure on the main host to switch on the slave and use them in read/write mode.
Following the instruction in slony documentation I was able to create the first part (i.e. the data mirroring on the slave), the second part is very far to be reached since the slave is locked. Is there any way to unlock the slave? It could be also accettable for me to destroy all the cluster information ?on the slave and to use them as the slony was never used and in case of newly availability of the master to dump/import the databases newly on the master and to recreate again the whole cluster, but I was not able to do this since it seems that there are a lot of "zombies" objects not identifieble in simply way, is there any chanche to use a sort of bigbang tool on the slave cleaning up all slony structures (but leaving the business data unchanged)?
I guess there is the possibility that this email address is not that I have to use, if this is the case, I would ask if there is any address(or forum) I can use.
Many thanks in advance.
Fabio.?

Subject: [Slony1-general] FOR UPDATE query
Message-ID: <1338800824.92959.YahooMailNeo@web28706.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hi, 
I found in my server the following query, waiting for more than 1 day.
?
SELECT * FROM "my_table" WHERE ("my_table"."id" = 2626968981)? FOR UPDATE;
?
It is not?coming form my client, in fact it is from the internal server.
My_table is a table involved in the slony, so I was wondering if this query is launched by slony process.
Can someone help me in understanding this? 
?
Thank you,
Laura Passigni

1) The FAILOVER command will unlock the tables on the slave. See 
http://www.slony.info/documentation/1.2/stmtfailover.html

2) Use the UNINSTALL NODE 
http://www.slony.info/documentation/1.2/stmtuninstallnode.html command 
to uninstall slony on the slave

The UNINSTALL NODE command will remove all the slony information on the 
slave.

That doesn't seem like a query that Slony would generate.

If you have set up Slony to use its own user, then you could check
pg_stat_activity, and validate that that query isn't being run as that
user.

Subject: [Slony1-general] creating a new trigger for a table on a slave host
Message-ID: <BLU166-W3030AE8EF3E51FD36A32CABA0C0@phx.gbl>










I need to modify my database schema and create a new trigger function. I know that triggers are suppressed on the slave once Slony starts up. However since slony is now already running on the slave, if I create a new trigger there, it will not be suppressed. What is the best practice for creating a trigger on the slave? Should you take the table out of replication, create trigger , then add the table back in? Is there some other way to do it? 
Thanks!

What version of slony?? 


For 1.2 and earlier add the trigger via slonik and use store trigger if you want to enable it:

http://slony.info/documentation/1.2/stmtstoretrigger.html

For 2.0 and later use DISABLE/ENABLE [REPLICA|ALWAYS] TRIGGER in postgresql.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Slony initial subscription is causing
 out-of-memory kernel panics. Why?
Message-ID: <9275DB4EA36C2542985A16A04243E85A591F9A@mbx025-e1-nj-8.exch025.domain.local>

Context:

We run Slony 2.0 with Postgres 8.4 on two CentOS 6 servers--one master, and one slave. Our database is about 30GB in size, which isn't unusual, but we do have a couple of tables that are more than 5GB each.

Recently, we needed to re-build our Slony cluster. I turned off Slony, restored identical database snapshots on the master and the slave, set up my slony.conf and slon_tools.conf, started the slons, ran slonik_init_cluster | slonik, then slonik_create_set 1 | slonik (we only have one replication set), and finally slonik_subscribe_set 1 2 | slonik. Everything looked good, and I was able to watch subscription progress in the logs.

Then the server stopped responding. I rebooted it, and saw "Kernel panic - not syncing: Out of memory and no killable processes" after it had killed everything it could.

It happens during the subscription process when our first "large" (3GB) table is encountered. The logs report "so and so bytes copied for table" for the table in question, then a few dozen queued SYNC events, and then they detect a child process crash and log a watchdog-initialized restart.



What I've tried:

First I blew away the database completely, re ran initdb, and then restored the identical snapshots again. Same kernel panic. Then I blew it away, uninstalled Postgres and Slony, and reinstalled them. I double-checked all of our memory-based settings in postgresql.conf, and they are all at stock/recommended levels (i.e. shared_buffers is at 1/4 of RAM etc etc). I ran a VACUUM ANALYZE FULL on the database before initializing the Slony cluster. As a last-ditch effort, I completely reinstalled the OS and all base software on the db servers and started from scratch. Same result every time: kernel panic, out of memory. It happens on the slave server, which runs both of the slons.



Question:

Why is this happening?

Our database has grown fairly linearly over the past few months (at the beginning of the year it was about 23GB, now it's 30), and every other time I have had to re-initialize the Slony cluster on these same servers, it has worked fine.

3. Does the SUBSCRIBE SET  actually finish before the crash?

4. If after the crash you restart postgresql and slon (but don't delete 
anything, perform an initdb or reinstall slony) what happens?

1. 2.0.7, correct.
2. I don't know for certain. I'm running another initial subscribe right now but it will take some time before it gets to the critical point. I would assume that the Slons are the ones eating memory, since I know from experience that the OOM killer will kill Postgres quite readily. Something that the OOM killer can't touch is leading to the system running out of memory, so I'd assume the Slons.
3. No, it doesn't. It gets part of the way through subscription of a large table and then the lots start showing watchdog-restarts, 4 or 5 times, and then the system kernel panics.
4. If I restart them after the crash without touching anything, the subscription process starts again from the very beginning.

I would assume that the Slons are the ones eating memory, since I know from experience that the OOM killer will kill Postgres quite readily. Something that the OOM killer can't touch is leading to the system running out of memory, so I'd assume the Slons.

Keep an eye on it.  I can't think of a reason why the slon memory 
footprint should grow like that.

What is the reason/message given for the slon workers being killed? Is 
the OOM killer, killing them?

Off the top of my head I can't think of a reason why the OOM killer 
couldn't kill a slon.  (should the OOM killer be killing slons is a 
different question).
