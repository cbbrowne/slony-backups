Subject: [Slony1-general] Question on failover on slony 1.23
Message-ID: <1338575996.81198.YahooMailNeo@web29704.mail.ird.yahoo.com>



?
Dear all,

I used the slony v1.23 to create a cluster on a postgres db v8.0.x, I am using this old version of slony since, due to constraints on software using the db I cannot upgrade the postgres version.
The database to be put in safety using slony is composed of 4 databases.
The main goal I need to reach is to have a master and a slave containing the same data and, in case of failure on the main host to switch on the slave and use them in read/write mode.
Following the instruction in slony documentation I was able to create the first part (i.e. the data mirroring on the slave), the second part is very far to be reached since the slave is locked. Is there any way to unlock the slave? It could be also accettable for me to destroy all the cluster information ?on the slave and to use them as the slony was never used and in case of newly availability of the master to dump/import the databases newly on the master and to recreate again the whole cluster, but I was not able to do this since it seems that there are a lot of "zombies" objects not identifieble in simply way, is there any chanche to use a sort of bigbang tool on the slave cleaning up all slony structures (but leaving the business data unchanged)?
I guess there is the possibility that this email address is not that I have to use, if this is the case, I would ask if there is any address(or forum) I can use.
Many thanks in advance.
Fabio.?
