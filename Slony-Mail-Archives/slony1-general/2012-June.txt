Subject: [Slony1-general] Question on failover on slony 1.23
Message-ID: <1338575996.81198.YahooMailNeo@web29704.mail.ird.yahoo.com>



?
Dear all,

I used the slony v1.23 to create a cluster on a postgres db v8.0.x, I am using this old version of slony since, due to constraints on software using the db I cannot upgrade the postgres version.
The database to be put in safety using slony is composed of 4 databases.
The main goal I need to reach is to have a master and a slave containing the same data and, in case of failure on the main host to switch on the slave and use them in read/write mode.
Following the instruction in slony documentation I was able to create the first part (i.e. the data mirroring on the slave), the second part is very far to be reached since the slave is locked. Is there any way to unlock the slave? It could be also accettable for me to destroy all the cluster information ?on the slave and to use them as the slony was never used and in case of newly availability of the master to dump/import the databases newly on the master and to recreate again the whole cluster, but I was not able to do this since it seems that there are a lot of "zombies" objects not identifieble in simply way, is there any chanche to use a sort of bigbang tool on the slave cleaning up all slony structures (but leaving the business data unchanged)?
I guess there is the possibility that this email address is not that I have to use, if this is the case, I would ask if there is any address(or forum) I can use.
Many thanks in advance.
Fabio.?

Subject: [Slony1-general] FOR UPDATE query
Message-ID: <1338800824.92959.YahooMailNeo@web28706.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hi, 
I found in my server the following query, waiting for more than 1 day.
?
SELECT * FROM "my_table" WHERE ("my_table"."id" = 2626968981)? FOR UPDATE;
?
It is not?coming form my client, in fact it is from the internal server.
My_table is a table involved in the slony, so I was wondering if this query is launched by slony process.
Can someone help me in understanding this? 
?
Thank you,
Laura Passigni

1) The FAILOVER command will unlock the tables on the slave. See 
http://www.slony.info/documentation/1.2/stmtfailover.html

2) Use the UNINSTALL NODE 
http://www.slony.info/documentation/1.2/stmtuninstallnode.html command 
to uninstall slony on the slave

The UNINSTALL NODE command will remove all the slony information on the 
slave.

That doesn't seem like a query that Slony would generate.

If you have set up Slony to use its own user, then you could check
pg_stat_activity, and validate that that query isn't being run as that
user.

Subject: [Slony1-general] creating a new trigger for a table on a slave host
Message-ID: <BLU166-W3030AE8EF3E51FD36A32CABA0C0@phx.gbl>










I need to modify my database schema and create a new trigger function. I know that triggers are suppressed on the slave once Slony starts up. However since slony is now already running on the slave, if I create a new trigger there, it will not be suppressed. What is the best practice for creating a trigger on the slave? Should you take the table out of replication, create trigger , then add the table back in? Is there some other way to do it? 
Thanks!

What version of slony?? 


For 1.2 and earlier add the trigger via slonik and use store trigger if you want to enable it:

http://slony.info/documentation/1.2/stmtstoretrigger.html

For 2.0 and later use DISABLE/ENABLE [REPLICA|ALWAYS] TRIGGER in postgresql.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Slony initial subscription is causing
 out-of-memory kernel panics. Why?
Message-ID: <9275DB4EA36C2542985A16A04243E85A591F9A@mbx025-e1-nj-8.exch025.domain.local>

Context:

We run Slony 2.0 with Postgres 8.4 on two CentOS 6 servers--one master, and one slave. Our database is about 30GB in size, which isn't unusual, but we do have a couple of tables that are more than 5GB each.

Recently, we needed to re-build our Slony cluster. I turned off Slony, restored identical database snapshots on the master and the slave, set up my slony.conf and slon_tools.conf, started the slons, ran slonik_init_cluster | slonik, then slonik_create_set 1 | slonik (we only have one replication set), and finally slonik_subscribe_set 1 2 | slonik. Everything looked good, and I was able to watch subscription progress in the logs.

Then the server stopped responding. I rebooted it, and saw "Kernel panic - not syncing: Out of memory and no killable processes" after it had killed everything it could.

It happens during the subscription process when our first "large" (3GB) table is encountered. The logs report "so and so bytes copied for table" for the table in question, then a few dozen queued SYNC events, and then they detect a child process crash and log a watchdog-initialized restart.



What I've tried:

First I blew away the database completely, re ran initdb, and then restored the identical snapshots again. Same kernel panic. Then I blew it away, uninstalled Postgres and Slony, and reinstalled them. I double-checked all of our memory-based settings in postgresql.conf, and they are all at stock/recommended levels (i.e. shared_buffers is at 1/4 of RAM etc etc). I ran a VACUUM ANALYZE FULL on the database before initializing the Slony cluster. As a last-ditch effort, I completely reinstalled the OS and all base software on the db servers and started from scratch. Same result every time: kernel panic, out of memory. It happens on the slave server, which runs both of the slons.



Question:

Why is this happening?

Our database has grown fairly linearly over the past few months (at the beginning of the year it was about 23GB, now it's 30), and every other time I have had to re-initialize the Slony cluster on these same servers, it has worked fine.

3. Does the SUBSCRIBE SET  actually finish before the crash?

4. If after the crash you restart postgresql and slon (but don't delete 
anything, perform an initdb or reinstall slony) what happens?

1. 2.0.7, correct.
2. I don't know for certain. I'm running another initial subscribe right now but it will take some time before it gets to the critical point. I would assume that the Slons are the ones eating memory, since I know from experience that the OOM killer will kill Postgres quite readily. Something that the OOM killer can't touch is leading to the system running out of memory, so I'd assume the Slons.
3. No, it doesn't. It gets part of the way through subscription of a large table and then the lots start showing watchdog-restarts, 4 or 5 times, and then the system kernel panics.
4. If I restart them after the crash without touching anything, the subscription process starts again from the very beginning.

Keep an eye on it.  I can't think of a reason why the slon memory

What is the reason/message given for the slon workers being killed? Is 
the OOM killer, killing them?

Off the top of my head I can't think of a reason why the OOM killer 
couldn't kill a slon.  (should the OOM killer be killing slons is a 
different question).

Hi All,

Can i get any slony recommendations for the replication of 3 TB Data with
slony. I mean, slon configuration parameters ..

As of now, it's copied 145 GB of data from Primary to slave and seems from
here onwards it's running very very very slow  .. No Errors in slony logs
and pg_logs ... Slon process is running with it's default configuration
parameters ...

Your help is highly appreciated ..

Thank You,

You don't tell us what version of slony your running. I would recommend 
you run at least 2.1.x.

1.2.x and 2.0.x have a performance bug that might mean that slony can 
fall so far behind on the initial sync that it might never catch up.

Has your initial copy_set finished?

Thank you so much Steve ...

We are using Slony 2.1.x ... We are still at the initial stage only...
Slony is still trying to copy the data from source to destination host ..

>> Has your initial copy_set finished?

Here only, we are facing problem... Slony struggling to copy the data .. It
went well upto 140 GB. From 141GB onwards  the build started slow.. Now
it's very very very slow ...

Let me know if you need any configurations what we have used ...

Thanks again for your response ..

Best Regards,
Dinesh

Are you doing this copy over a WAN?
How long is this taking? How long does it normally take you to load a 
pg_dump of your 3TB database on this hardware?

Can you tell what the bottleneck is? Are you IO bound on the slave? Are 
you CPU bound on the slave?

There isn't a lot of slony configuration that controls the intial sync 
which is done by COPY.  There are a bunch of parameters that control the 
behaviour to process normal SYNC events after your initial subscription 
but I don't think those would effect the intial copy.

We are doing copy over LAN.. We got very good transfer rate for up to some
extent.. From after some time (i'm not sure the exact time), the build got
slow..

We think, it's problem from the db itself.. We have around  400GB tables (5
to 8), those are having huge bloats also.. We think, slony is taking some
time to get those live rows bypassing the dead rows from DB. So we think,
the actual live rows might scatter to multiple files. I think this might be
the root cause ..

We just stopped the existing slony setup and will perform vacuum on DB once
and will do it again ...

Can we get the slony event configuration parameters what we need to tune.
So that, we will try those from our side with sample setup ...

If we configure the slony sets like (set 1 having 10 tables of size  400 GB
and set 2 having 10 tables of size 400 GB size .... ) is it good? Which is
the better option ?

Is Slony completes set1 and then only moves to set2 ... ? Or it switching
between the sets ..?

Kindly suggest us ...

Thank you,
Dinesh

We need to know why.

What does iostat -xd 10 or such have to say about the performance on
the new slony destination when it's slow?

I doubt bloat in the source database would make things 1GB/hr slow.
That's only 16MB/minute.

Yeah, this time try and figure out what the bottleneck is via iostat,
vmstat, iotop, nettop, select * from pg_stat_activity and so on.

Thanks scott ...

This time we will track why it's been slow ..

	tables ?
Message-ID: <CANwAqWhSvR7jiMSGCVBiXeERgYfF+5-23rfyDaBP+=dG=fS9pQ@mail.gmail.com>

Respected all,

Currently we are in process of upgrading PG 8.4 to PG 9.1 using Slony 2.1.
We have successfully configured Slony 2.1 on to PG 9.1 & 8.4 and its
running fine.
Since the database is 1.5+ TB with large tables, how could we fast the
Slave to catch up Sync with primary ?
What are the parameter's need to be tuned at Slony Level & PostgreSQL level
?

Current Setup :
OS: RHEL 6
DB : PG 9.1 & 8.4
Slony: 2.1

Please advice.

Hi,
I have 2 versions of Postgres on my test machine (8.4 and 9.0).
After installing Slony, it has been installed in the postgres 9.0, but I would like to have Slony?in Postgres 8.4.
?
I would like to know how to configure Slony for postgres 8.4. Is it feasible? 
?
Thank you,
Laura

Hi Laura,

You have to compil the same Slony version both PG 8.4 and PG 9.0

For 8.4, You need


- the headers files for PostgreSQL 8.4. So you can compile Slony.

- Slony sources; Version depends on the Slony version already installed for PG 9.0

It is. Assuming that you have the devel packages for both Postgres 
versions installed (headers and libraries).

I suggest installing the same Slony version from sources for both 
database version, so you can also replicate between the two. You would 
configure and "make install" two times. The configure script has an 
option to explicitly specify the directory of the pg_config utility to 
use. The sequence would then look like this:

configure --with-pgconfigdir=/path/to/bin/directory/of/pg_config-8.4
make all install clean
configure --with-pgconfigdir=/path/to/bin/directory/of/pg_config-9.0
make all install clean

Hello,

I found the directions for building Slony-I on a Win32 platform.  I am wondering if the same directions will work compiling against PostgreSQL 9.0 x86-64?  Another component in our system requires the x86-64 version so we are stuck using it and we just ran into the issue where replication gets so far behind in Slony-I 2.0.4 (from Stack Builder) that it can't catch up so we are looking to upgrade.

I've never tried it but I suspect it will.
If you hit any errors let me know and I will look into finding a Windows 
x86-64 environment to debug things in.

I will do that.  Currently downloading the Microsoft 6.1 SDK to attempt to build it.

Using pthreads 2.9.1 and gettext runtime .013.1 I get the attached error when running "nmake /f win32.mak slon.exe".  Below are my environment variables.  Do you think it would it be worth reinstalling PostgreSQL in a path without spaces?

Actually, just switching it to the 64-bit lib folder for pthreads got it working.  Although now comes the fun time of setting this up.

Aha,,, for a moment I thought I was on wrong page, but am very much on
right page. I can see my posting on Slony Mailing list Archives.
http://lists.slony.info/pipermail/slony1-general/2012-June/author.html

Can you guys share your thoughts on my query. To fast the slave sync catch
up, I disabled Autovacuum and increase memory parameters at database level,
coming to slony level, I played a bit with sync_interval &
sync_interval_timeout, but it didnt helped me much.

Someone asked a similar question a few days ago, my comments 
http://lists.slony.info/pipermail/slony1-general/2012-June/012217.html 
mostly apply to you as well.

The Slony initial COPY SET needs to copy the entire contents of the table. 
This will be no faster than the time it would take to perform a pg_dump. 
Normal rules for speed up bulk loads with postgresql apply.  Are you IO 
bound, CPU bound or network bound?

The sync_interval and sync_interval_timeout only come into play AFTER the 
initial copy_set is done (I think).

I guess I spoke to soon.  I get an error trying to run slonik saying "The program can't start because MSVCR90.dll is missing from your computer.  Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.".  Do the MS Visual C++ 2008 redistributables need to be installed?

Actually, just switching it to the 64-bit lib folder for pthreads got it working.  Although now comes the fun time of setting this up.

Is there a x86-64 lib for pthreads? Do you need one?

Make sure that file (It comes somewhere in the SDK, use search to find 
where) is either in the same directory as your slonik binary file,  or 
is in your PATH (I forget which one).

Has to be in the same directory as the slonik executable.  Got the cluster built, everything setup and am going to attempt to turn it on shortly.  However, clicking anything in pgAdmin III related to Slony gives me the following.

2012-06-14 11:39:19 INFO   : Displaying properties for Slony-I cluster test_repset

Also, the WIN32 compile instructions don't list how to compile slevent.dll, is there a way to do this to make "pretty" error messages in the Windows Event Viewer?  Or would a version of the DLL from Slony 2.0.4 work for that single use?

I doubt pgadmin III works with slony 2.1 I don't know if the pgadmin 
guys have been keeping up to date with slony changes (I'm not even sure 
how well it work with slony 2.0).  I suspect this isn't a MS-Windows issue.

You shouldn't need slevent.dll anymore.  Is it pgadmin that tries to use 
it or something else?

Slevent.dll is used by Windows Event Viewer to make it easier to read Application event logs from Slony.

Yep, I pulled a copy of it from 2.0.4 and it works fine.  Since all it does it some translation it isn't probably a huge deal to get it done anytime soon :)

The old version (from 2.0.x) should work fine.

I'll try to write up a Visual C makefile to build that as well (I hadn't realized what that was used for)

Some commits fixed issues with 2.0, but, AFAIK, no tests have been done
on 2.1.

Yep, almost similar.

So, COPY SET is similar the count of pg_dump time. Ok. Got it.

Ok.

I have another question for which I will be starting another thread after
this reply.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Sl_archive_tracking table not found in Slony 2.1
Message-ID: <CANwAqWhnenr0CHrY6g_AeV2TWS7hqY0NgcLRzh9gSKZ63pZSzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have compiled Slony-I 2.1 to PG 9.1. My replication setup went well and I
could replicate the data. In my testing am using Slony Log shipping and
generating .SQL files.
As per documentation all .sql files are tracked with sl_archive_tracking
 table, however if execute a query it says its not exist.


postgres=# select * from _myrep.sl_archive_tracking;
ERROR:  relation "_myrep.sl_archive_tracking" does not exist
LINE 1: select * from _myrep.sl_archive_tracking;

Q: Is this table deprecated in Slony-I 2.1 or its been renamed to
sl_archive_counter ?

tools/slony1_dump.sh should create this table on the log shipping 
destination.  This script dumps the data from the replica running slon in 
log shipping mode and restores it + some extra functions/tables to on the 
destination/target node.

I followed the below process,

1. Start slon process with Log enabling ( slon -a option)
2. Execute the tools/slony1_dump.sh
     sh tools/slony1_dump.sh  <subscriber_dbname>  <clustername>

After above two steps, still I won't see any table created under
_myrep(slony schema). Create Table/function etc., everything shown on
terminal but not created in slonyschema.  Correct me if anything wrong in
my steps.

The output of slony1_dump.sh IS the SQL that you need to run against the 
logshipping target to create those tables (and otherwise setup that target). 
You'd pass that SQL to psql running on your log shipping target.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Adding third node going in waiting
Message-ID: <CANwAqWg9tL6zt2HhMSY+7JEcMbKii2kxcDt2CkL9UfA5Po9DZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Steve,

Firstly, Thanks for all the help to my other thread I raised and helping me
in moving forward with my testing.
Am playing a bit with Slony these days on high end replication solutions.

Am using Slony-I 2.1.0, I followed the documentation for adding the node to
the existing replication, however when I try to subscribe the new node its
going into waiting. Am doing in localhost of same cluster with multiple
databases.

1. Create database
create database slave2;

2. Restore the master structure to slave2;

pg_dump -h localhost -s -p 5432 -d master | psql slave

3. Drop _myrep schema which copied by pg_dump to slave ( Note: This is not
documented, I suspect when we copy masterdb schema structure u also get the
_slonyschema as well. Which throw error as _slonyschema existing. Do we
really need master _slonyschema to new node ?)

psql -d slave -c "drop schema _myrep cascade;"

4. below is the script to add new node:

#!/bin/bash

slonik <<_eof_
cluster name = myrep;
node 1 admin conninfo='host=127.0.0.1 dbname=master user=postgres
port=5432';
node 2 admin conninfo='host=127.0.0.1 dbname=slave1 user=postgres
port=5432';
node 3 admin conninfo='host=127.0.0.1 dbname=slave2 user=postgres
port=5432';

store node (id = 3, event node = 1, comment = 'Slave2 Node For The Primary
postgres');

#Setting Store Paths ...
echo  'Stored all nodes in the slony catalogs';
store path(server = 1, client = 3, conninfo='host=127.0.0.1 dbname=master
user=postgres port=5432');
store path(server = 3, client = 1, conninfo='host=127.0.0.1 dbname=slave2
user=postgres port=5432');
_eof_

This goes fine..

5. When I do subscribe its going into waiting stage.

Subscribe script:

#!/bin/bash
# Subscribe node

slonik <<_eof_
cluster name = myrep;
node 1 admin conninfo='host=127.0.0.1 dbname=master user=postgres
port=5432';
node 2 admin conninfo='host=127.0.0.1 dbname=slave user=postgres port=5432';
node 3 admin conninfo='host=127.0.0.1 dbname=slave2 user=postgres
port=5432';

try { subscribe set (id = 1, provider = 1 , receiver = 3, forward = yes,
omit copy = false); } on error { exit 1; } echo  'Subscribed nodes to set
1';
_eof_

output of the subscribe node;
-bash-4.1$ ./new_node_subscribe-set.sh
waiting for events  (3,5000000001) only at (3,0) to be confirmed on node 1
waiting for events  (3,5000000001) only at (3,0) to be confirmed on node 1
waiting for events  (3,5000000001) only at (3,0) to be confirmed on node 1

I found the link which pointing to some bug. Correct me, how to achive this.

No you do not need to dump the slonyschema, you can exclude that from 
your dump.

Did you start the slon daemon for the new node?  If not, starting the 
slon daemon for the new node should allow things to replicate.

Subject: [Slony1-general] How to perform updates on a table slave
Message-ID: <B1919E8234324713B17E4114699AE877@CMOTUM25PC>

Hello.

We want to use Slony to keep our 2 servers replicated, however several tables are being accesed by Java processes that perform updates on them, Slony doesn?t this allow to happen. Is there a way to allow this?.

Thank you.

Slony created disable triggers on Slave. So no write access is allowed.

Small things, create big problems .. :). Yes after starting Slave slon
daemon, everything goes well.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Swapping Providers
Message-ID: <CANwAqWggSUrkzSP8bnc11+udsnUZb-gy9xhndjLPPXv-nLsV7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Steve,

Below is the scenario I want to achieve.


                      Warm-Standby
Master  ------------------------------------------------ DR-Master
    |
    |    Replication built on  Slony 2.1.
    |
   V
Slave

Given is actually setup of production, master/slave replication with log
archive shipping using slony 2.1. And, Master with DR setup on same data
center as DR-Master with Warm Standby configuration running fine with
minimal lag.

Q: What I want to achieve ?
A:  Swap the Masters. Means, now slave should receive events from DR-Master
once it get promoted to Master as shown below

Master   DR Master

    |            |
   X           |    Replication built on  Slony 2.1.

    |            |

   V            |

Slave <------|


I believed, the DR-Master will have the same _slonyschema except the
primary hostname. So, I have changed on both DR-Master & Slave of sl_path
of primary hostname as fix.
Assuming that, I have tested on my local box with below steps.

1. Stop slony between master,slave.
2. Take the _slonyschema dump of Master (In case any problem).
3. Promote the DR-Master.
4. update the _slonyschem.sl_path of column pa_conninfo with primary
hostname on DR-Master & Slave.
5. Start slony daemons on DR-Master & Slave.

Above steps won't work all the time, I did many times, very few times I
could able to send events from DR-master to Slave with proper numbering of
.SQL files.(log archives).
I would request to recommend the correct procedure for swapping providers.
