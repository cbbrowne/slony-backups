What is the reason for this setup? If the two slaves are subscribed to 
different sets of tables, then the same can be achieved by creating 
multiple sets and subscribing the slaves to individual combinations of 
them.

No reason besides we were new to slony and had no idea what we were doing
at the beginning and now it will be a hassle to change for everyone that
has this.

I've committed a change to the documentation to include a

The hassle right now seems to be that you can submit the EXECUTE SCRIPT 
only to one of the two clusters. With this setup it is impossible to do 
it for both.

So you can either deal with the hassle of changing the setup to a single 
cluster with multiple subscriber (slave) nodes, or figure out a way to 
do the schema changes without using EXECUTE SCRIPT. Pick your lesser hassle.

Hi,

I would like to use Slony without any network connection from the slaves to the master.
The network allows only flows from master to slaves.

Is there any option that I missed to do that ?

Thank-you in advance.

Regards,

Ludovic Toinel

Not really.  In principle you could do this with the log shipping
mode, but I don't recall whether doing that on the master was not
possible or just a really bad idea.  (You could do this with the
built-in standby mechanisms of Postgres, though.

I do wonder why you have it set up this way, however.  Why do you
control the flows this way?

Thanks Andrew,

We are not allowed to have network connection from the slaves to the master (for security constraints). Only master can communicate with slaves.
We need database on slaves with mix replicates tables and read/write tables.

The solution could be maybe that solution using a slony master has an Hot standby of a master protected somewhere ? 

[slony slaves] <-----> [slony master - Standby node] <----(log shipping)--|firewall|-- [master protected somewhere]

Do you think this solution can work with slony ?

Regards,

Ludovic Toinel

Not really.  In principle you could do this with the log shipping mode, but I don't recall whether doing that on the master was not possible or just a really bad idea.  (You could do this with the built-in standby mechanisms of Postgres, though.

I do wonder why you have it set up this way, however.  Why do you control the flows this way?

This will work as long as you don't try to execute write queries on the
slony master, because it's a standby node and, as such, can only execute
read queries. Meaning I'm wondering why you would use such a scheme.

I?m trying to find the best way to separate the master from the slaves for security requirements.

In terms of network, I?m not allow to get connection from slaves to master.
In terms of database, I use per table granularity replication.

Any other idea ?

You really should think about a VPN between nodes. It would simplify your
architecture.

But, in theory, subscriber nodes could be on a DMZ. They can be accessed by
daemons, but you don't need them to access providers.
Your daemons would run on a node that can access every other node.


BTW, there are no real master and slaves in Slony. There are nodes, which can
be subscribers (receiving modifications readonly), and providers (read/write).
And you can have a subscriber of a set that is provider of another.

 Only master can communicate with slaves.

Is there a way to have subscribers with no direct SQL access to the provider ? 

The provider write the data on the subscribers directly.

(Top-posting makes it really hard to follow discussions in a thread.)

Your slon daemons need to run on a node that can see everyone.

So, for instance, you can have them on node A which is provider for SET 1 and
2, but subscriber of SET 3 from node B.
And you can't psql from NodeB to NodeA.


Should work.

(The provider logs modification on a log table, which is read by daemons. And
propagated to other nodes.)

To repeat what Stephane said

The slon daemon doesn't need to run on the same server as the replica 
database.

You can put the slon dameons for both the replicas and the orign on the 
origin node (or some other node that can access all nodes).  That way 
the replica database server doesn't need to open network connections 
anywhere.

The slon for the replica (which you are running on the originr or 
somewhere similar) can connect to both the replica and origin database 
servers.

I presume that this is a restriction on your routers or gateways and 
that the initiating SYN packet for a new TCP connection cannot come from 
what you envision to be the Slave.

If that is correct, you can run all the slon daemons on what you 
consider the Master. All TCP connections are then initiated from the 
Master. This has little to no effect on how Slony functions.

Excellent ! That solution solve my problem. We can deploy the Slony subscriber on the protected zone.

Thank-you for your feedbacks.

Subject: [Slony1-general] remote listener serializability
Message-ID: <D26F49AE.41208%ttignor@akamai.com>


Hello slony1 community,
I'm part of a team at Akamai working on a notification service based on postgres. (We call it an Alert Management System.) We're at the point where we need to scale past the single instance DB and so have been working with slony1-2.2.4 (and postgresql-9.1.18) to make that happen. Most tests in the past few months have been great, but in recent tests the reassuring SYNC-event-output-per-two-seconds suddenly disappeared. Throughout the day, it returns for a few minutes (normally less than 5, never 10) and then re-enters limbo. Vigorous debugging ensued, and the problem was proven to be the serializable isolation level set in slon/remote_listen.c. Our recent test environment doesn't have a tremendous write rate (measured in KB/s), but it does have 200-400 clients at any one time, which may be a factor. Below is the stack shown in gdb of the postgres server proc (identified via pg_stat_activity) while slon is in limbo.
What are the thoughts on possible changes to the remote listener isolation level and their impact? I've tested changes using repeatable read instead, and also with serializable but dropping the deferrable option. The latter offers little improvement if any, but the former seems to return us to healthy replication. In searching around, I found Jan W filed Bug 336 last year (link below) which suggests we could relax the isolation level here and elsewhere. If it was helpful, I could verify an agreed solution and submit it back as a patch. (Not really in the slony community yet, just looking at the process now.)
Thanks in advance,

The last time we had a change to isolation levels was in response to 
this thread


http://lists.slony.info/pipermail/slony1-general/2011-November/011939.html

Also know as bug #255 (http://www.slony.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=255)

I can't recall if anyone figured out if we could reduce the remote 
listener isolation level to read committed - read only or not.

One concern at the back of my mind is if a read only repeatable read 
transactions would result in more pivot conflicts than a read only 
serializable deferrable transaction where the conflicts are with a 
serializable transaction running on the origin by some application 
transaction.

Message-ID: <42B5229E-D607-439E-A90D-5CAFD005F4C0@gmail.com>

Hi

Please pardon the length of this email but I felt it is best to give a global view

I was looking at slonik for a project. 
All the setup info, tutorials etc etc seems to vary

http://raghavt.blogspot.com/2012/07/simple-slony-i-replication-setup.html
and
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7834

Just to name two sources of study


So I used two approaches

1 - Passing commands to slonik directly. All ok 
2 - Using the provided perl scripts . Not ok and this is where I would like some tips , guidance

master node: 192.168.5.221
master db: primdb


slave node: 192.168.5.222
slave db: bkdb

I use .pgpass 


/etc/slony1-94/slon_tools.conf

I stripped out all comments to keep things to a minimum

And now the questions/steps

a	-     add_node(node     => 1,
             host     => '192.168.5.221',
             dbname   => 'primdb',
             port     => 5432,
             user     => 'postgres',
             password => '',
             config   => '/path/to/node1_config_file.conf');




I presume this would be config   => '/etc/slony1-94/slon_tools.conf' or am I wrong ?

I think the config file should be to slon config file not a slon_tools.conf

ie the format is

cluster_name=myrep
pid_file='/opt/PostgreSQL/9.1/data/master_slon.pid'
conn_info='host=localhost dbname=master user=postgres port=5432'

http://www.slony.info/documentation/2.2/runtime-config.html

Or see  slon_node.conf.sample which I think is included with the perl tools

Hi Steve


Thank you for your reply

I guess that would be /etc/slony1-94/slon.conf



But see what confuses me is this. All slonik* perl script reference this

slonik_drop_node:$CONFIG_FILE = '/etc/slony1-94/slon_tools.conf';


I guess then /etc/slony1-94/slon_tools.conf should be referencing /etc/slony1-94/slon.conf


Will try that and see how that goes


Thanks
Armand
