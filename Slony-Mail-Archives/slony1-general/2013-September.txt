Subject: [Slony1-general] Slony 2.2.0 released
Message-ID: <522E316F.3060207@ca.afilias.info>

The Slony team is pleased to announce the first official release of 
version 2.2 of the Slony replication engine.

Slony 2.2.0 adds the following major features to Slony 2.1.x

* Slony now uses the COPY command for replicating data between providers 
and subscribers.  This will result in faster replication times and more 
efficient resource utilization on the replica for many workloads

* The FAILOVER command has been made more reliable for complex cluster 
configurations.   The FAILOVER command now supports the failure of 
multiple nodes at the same time.  All users of the FAILOVER should read 
the documentation to familiarize themselves with these changes

* Multiple versions of slony can now be installed under the same 
PostgreSQL cluster.  The Slony shared libraries, functions and .sql 
files are now versioned to support this


A full list of changes can be found in the release notes at
http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=slony1-engine.git;a=blob_plain;f=RELEASE;hb=52e6127d264662997e69bf0d07f947aebf4c7c61

Subject: [Slony1-general] Log shipping supplier crashed
Message-ID: <CE54ABE9.54FF%mjames@profitpoint.com>

I have been sending slony1 logs over a WAN to replicate to a remote server. A couple of days ago, the slave that was sending logs crashed. It was rebooted successfully a couple of hours later, but it looks like log shipping did not resume.

There are a few logs with 0 length on the provider, but they can't be consumed by the remote server on the other end of the WAN.

Is there any way to recover gracefully from this outage?

Thanks, Mike

What version of slony are you running, and does slony_logshipper exit 
immediately after starting up  or stay running and but does nothing? Does it 
print anything in its logfile?
