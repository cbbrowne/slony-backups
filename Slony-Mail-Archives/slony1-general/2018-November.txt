Subject: [Slony1-general] Unique constraint violation issue
Message-ID: <CC6B1935-D94A-4718-A524-21D7F287A2B2@pgexperts.com>

I am seeing an issue which I believe relates to "7.1.8.4. Replication Fails - Unique Constraint Violation? in the frequently asked questions section of the documentation. Could anyone point me to any additional information on this topic? Perhaps some of the original discussions which prompted this to be included in the FAQs.

Thank you,

Kacey

Hi,
Have you tried to restart replication by way of un-subscribing and re-subscribing the set for the failing table or are you only after the additional information on that topic ?
