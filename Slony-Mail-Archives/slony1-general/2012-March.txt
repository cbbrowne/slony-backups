Subject: [Slony1-general] Cascading replication using altperl scripts
Message-ID: <CBE9D0DADE0A492383F7107721DB9BB4@CMOTUM25PC>

Hello list:
My name is Efrain and this week I?ve been using Slony-I, with the help of the documentation I?ve been able to setup replication between 2 nodes using slonik scripts and also with altperl scripts. For me, using altperl scritps is more comfortable but now I?m stucked trying to set cascading replication. I have this in mind:
A1 ?> B1 ?> B2
Meaning that A1 would be the master to B1 but also B1 would be master of B2. My slon_tools.conf looks like this:
add_node(node => 1,
host => '192.168.1.231',
dbname => 'prueba',
port => 5432,
user => 'postgres',
password => '1');
add_node(node => 2,
host => '192.168.1.232',
dbname => 'prueba',
port => 5432,
noforward => allow,
user => 'pgsql',
password => '2');
add_node(node => 3,
parent => 2,
host => '192.168.1.233',
dbname => 'prueba',
port => 5432,
user => 'pgsql',
password => '3');
I understand that B1 shall be configured to accept forward but I don?t now how to do this.
Any help would be really appreciated.
Thank you.

If I'm reading the documentation of 2.0 correctly I should be able to install
Slony 2.0 with PostgreSQL versions 7.3.3 and higher.  Yet when I run the
configure script on my box it is giving me an error saying I cannot do so
unless my version is 8.3  Am I missing something?

No Slony 2.0+ requires at least Postgersql 8.3

Slony 1.2.x will work with postgresql 8.1

Is it possible to install Slony without root or sudo permissions?  I've tried
in the past but been unable to do so.  I was using the --with-pgconfigdir
option only but I'm not sure what the other options buy me or if the use of
one of those options lets me accomplish my goal.  It appears they only let
me spread the slony files around my machine.

Use --prefix with configure :

./configure --prefix=/path/to/your/installation 

assuming that the user you compile and install slony has write access to
that specific directory.

That did not seem to work.  I'm getting the same error I get if I try it with
'with-pgconfigdir.

What I did:

 ./configure --prefix=/var/lib/pgsql/slony
 gmake all
 gmake install

Yet I get the following error:

$ gmake install
gmake[1]: Entering directory `/tmp/slony1-1.2.23/src'
gmake[2]: Entering directory `/tmp/slony1-1.2.23/src/xxid'

gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/slony1-1.2.23/src'

I know I have write access as I created the /var/lib/pgsql/slony directory
as the postgres user(the same user I am trying the install as).

Thanks

Ah yes, the issue is that you need a few .so files installed in the postgresql libdir.  that appears to be: /usr/lib64/pgsql on your installation.  

BTW, any chance you could subscribe to the mailing list so we don't have to keep moderating each one of your emails to the list?

I've subscribed.  Sorry, didn't realize I needed to do something...

About your reply, I'm not sure I completely follow you as I'm a bit green to
PostgreSQL.  What .so files am I missing?  How can they be missing if
PotgreSQL is working fine?  Do I need to specify other Slony options as I
run configure?

Subject: [Slony1-general] How to install slony with more than one version of

Message-ID: <33452102.post@talk.nabble.com>


I have a machine with two copies of Postgres on it.  I cannot remove the old
version as the admins will not allow that version to be removed.  The 2nd
version is the version I use and which to install Slony on.  I've used both
--prefix and --with-pgdconfigdir options, but the configure script still
keeps grabbing the other, older, incorrect version.  How can I install slony
and direct it to use only one of the two versions?

Try adjusting your shell PATH such that the new version is always
found first.  You might end up with the scripts finding the older
version's executables, causing such confusion.

Message-ID: <1331117844.5271.YahooMailNeo@web28504.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi, 
I have a big database (about 1350GB) with Slony replica (1 master and 1 slave).
Last week I have had a network crash between master and slave server. Unfortunately there was a bulk import in progress in the master database.?As result the slave server?was not in sync with the master for few days. 
There are now about 80.000 records in the sl_event table and the sync is very slow. I have seen in the log file that the sync of each event requires about 1500/2000 seconds. It is a very huge time.
Is there something that I can do? Is there some faster way to sync the databases? 

Thank you,
Laura

Hello,

?We're replicating a PostgreSQL 8.4.x database using Slony1-1.2.x

?The origin database "data/base" directory is 197 GB in size.

?The slave database "data/base" directory is 562 GB in size and is
?over 75% filesystem utilization which has set off the "disk free" siren.

?My biggest table* measures 154 GB on the origin, and 533 GB on
?the slave. ?(*As reported by

?SELECT relname as "Table", pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(relid))
? As "Size" from pg_catalog.pg_statio_user_tables
? ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(relid) DESC;
?)

?I took a peek at this table on the slave using pgadmin3. The table
?has auto-vacuum enabled, and TOAST autovacuum enabled.

?There are 8.6 million live tuples, and 1.5 million dead tuples.

?Last autovacuum was over a month ago.

?Last autoanalyze was 3 hours ago.

?Table size is 4 Gigs, and TOAST table size is 527 Gigs.
?Indexes size is 3 Gigs.

?Autovacuum threshold is 20%, and the table is just under that threshold.

?I ran vacuum analyze verbose. ?But the filesystem is still at 76%
utilization.
?In fact, now, the "data/base" directory has grown to 565 GB.

?Why is my slave bigger than my master? ?How can I compact it, please?

Best,
Aleksey

It is possible that your issue is what we have been referring to as bug 
167.  This has been fixed in slony 2.1.0.  What happens is that when 
sl_log_1 or sl_log_2 grows beyond a certain size the query turns into a 
sequential scan.

Other than upgrading,  you need to push the sync interval up so you 
generate fewer syncs, and increase the sync_groupsize so it processes 
more syncs together.  This might allow slony to catch up.  Once it is 
caught up your sl_log tables will get truncated and you can go back to 
normal settings/operations.

If the problem is that your table is bloated

The CLUSTER command 
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/sql-cluster.html will compact 
your table.  The VACUUM command does not normally return unused space to 
the operating system (some exceptions apply)

Thank you, Steve.

I used "check_postgres" to check for bloat and it reported wasted size
only 1 GB.

table XYZ rows:8674174 pages:463848 shouldbe:318436 (1.5X) wasted
size:1191215104 (1 GB)

This does not seem much compared to table size on the master,
154 GB,and on the slave, 527 GB.

I can't run CLUSTER because I don't have another 500 GB free...  I am running
VACUUM FULL right now to return the unused disk space to the OS.
I wondering if it will free 1 GB or 300 GB.  I expect 1 GB, based on the
check_postgres "bloat" check results.

I'll run check_postgres "bloat" check again after the VACUUM FULL finishes.

This table does use TOAST and most of the data is in TOAST...  I wonder if the
1 GB size includes TOAST.

Best,
Aleksey

I ran VACUUM FULL on this table, but it is still over 500 GB in size.

 "check_postgres --action=bloat" now returns OK.  So it's not bloat.
 What else could it be, please?

I had a similar situation recently, and had to get it caught up on a 
slow connection.

I increased the group size to allow more events be processed at a time, 
it did help catch up a bit faster.

Normally I have all daemons running on one box, so I also killed the 
daemon for this slave and ran it on the actual slave that was behind. It 
sped the sync times up by about 4X.

Message-ID: <1331862742.79717.YahooMailNeo@web31816.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Looks like a odd situation; 

I have 2 sets, and one set with 3 tables and another with 50+ tables. Both the sets are replicated to two subscribers; one set has correct data, but second set two tables are off.

And both the subscribers are up2date with origin; but 2 tables out of 3, has wrong number of rows (way off) in subscriber-1;

So, whats the best way to re-copy or re-initiate these two tables copy only to subsriber-1 without subsriber-2 (it shares the set) as subscriber-2 is prod read facing.

Thanks for the help

How did you get your cluster into this situation?  Something has gone wrong.

I assume your still using 2.0.7 with PG 8.4

You can unsubscribe subscriber 1 from the set with the UNSUBSCRIBE SET 
command.  You can then resubscribe subscriber 1 with the
SUBSCRIBE SET command.  This should not effect subscriber 2.

Hello,

We are Master students from Cologne University of Applied Sciences Germany.
We are building a prototype for a biogas plant and we are having some
problems implementing the structure

We want do a Master-Slave replication between ubuntu(Master) and
windows(Slave) in PostgreSQL 9.1 using Slony2.1. we have problems in
installing slony 2.1 in ubuntu. The problem is after
configuring(./configure) and then compiling using command 'make' the file
in slony1-2.1.1/src/backend/slony1_funcs.c. The header file Miscadmin.h is
not found and most of the header files(nodes/makefuncs.h, etc.,) are not
found. We have attached the screenshot of the error for Miscadmin.h. We
need to know where we can find these header files and what is the problem
in it.

We are looking forward for your support.

Thanks & Regards
Esli

Also I just noticed you sent your email to like 6 different
recipients.  Please don't do that.  Pick one.  The slony1 general list
is a good starting place.

You need to install the postgresql development package for your distribution. 
I think that's postgresql-server-dev or something similar, on Ubuntu.

Slide 22 of that presentation specifically calls for specifying the

Guten Tag,

PgAdmin includes the very useful "StackBuilder" application, which will
download and install Slony-I (among many other things) for you. I don't
know what version of Slony the latest StackBuilder installs, but you'll
need to ensure that the Linux version matches - the versions of Slony
must be identical.

I hope this helps,

Ray.

Thank you for your answer.
I installed the new version (2.1.1) and it is faster. 
However I still have some delay, so I think that also some?
configurations are necessary, as you suggested.
Thank you,

It is possible that your issue is what we have been referring to as bug 167.? This has been fixed in slony 2.1.0.? What happens is that when sl_log_1 or sl_log_2 grows beyond a certain size the query turns into a sequential scan.

Other than upgrading,? you need to push the sync interval up so you generate fewer syncs, and increase the sync_groupsize so it processes more syncs together.? This might allow slony to catch up.? Once it is caught up your sl_log tables will get truncated and you can go back to normal settings/operations.

Hi,

In our postgresql 9.1 - stack builder, we dont have a slony option in the
replication section.Can you provide us with other options.

Thanks & Regards

http://www.slony.info/documentation/2.1/administration.html#BUILDINGWIN32

Has some high level instructions on compiling Slony on WIN32.  You could 
compile it yourself.

The Postgres-related stuff is likely to get defined suitably so that
pg_configure can find it all.

For third-party libraries, it'll all depend on how you installed the
third party libs.  In effect, if you installed them, you should know
where PTHREADS_INC, GETTEXT_LIB, and such are.

In the command window you would type something like

SET PTHREADS_INC "c:\\pthreads\\include"

to set the environment variable.   (This is the command prompt that the 
Win32 SDK (or MSVC) installs)

The paths would be the actual places that you installed all the third 
party packages and postgresql into.

Subject: [Slony1-general] Moveset changes to sub_forward
Message-ID: <1332191076.50097.YahooMailNeo@web31805.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi there

We have 3 nodes in cluster. 

After moving a set from one node (node-1) to another (node-2), whats the best way to reset the origin in another subscriber (node-3) as it still talking to node-1 as node-1 is doing forward of node-2 changes to node-3 ; rather I want node-3 directly talk to node-2 (new origin) without sub_forward by node-1.

The sl_subscribe looks like this:

engine_db=# select * from sl_subscribe where sub_set=1;
?sub_set | sub_provider | sub_receiver | sub_forward | sub_active 
---------+--------------+--------------+-------------+------------
?????? 1 |??????????? 1 |??????????? 3 | f?????????? | t
?????? 1 |??????????? 2 |??????????? 1 | t?????????? | t
(3 rows)

Rather, after moveset, I expected, line 1 to go away and line-2 to have direct replication to 3 instead of forward through 1.

Thanks for help
Brian

You can re-subscribe your nodes in a way that fits your needs.

Just issue subscribe sets commands, and tell node 3 to subscribe to 2.

Doesn't that cause the complete copy of whole tables ?

No, if a node is already subscribed, SUBSCRIBE SET just changes how it
is to draw its data.  It doesn't need to start over from scratch.

While that behaviour is documented, if you read the documentation
carefully, I'd agree that the present behaviour isn't totally
intuitive.  I do not find it surprising that you would imagine that it
*would* lead to a complete copy.

There have been some private conversations where the idea has come up
that perhaps we should have add sort of RESHAPE SUBSCRIPTION command,
so that:

- SUBSCRIBE SET would be reserved for the "do a COPY of the complete
set of data"
- RESHAPE SUBSCRIPTION makes configuration changes.

I don't think we agreed conclusively that such a change ought to be
made, but it would be an improvement in the sense that it would fit
with your intuition.

Actually the RESUBSCRIBE_NODE command is checked into master for 2.2.0.
In 2.2 it is the only way to reshape certain types of cluster.   Venu 
should be able to use the subscribe command in 2.1 or earlier.
